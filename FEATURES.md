    - **ETH (Restaking & Liquidity Layer)**:  ETH is used as a restaking and liquidity layer, providing economic security. $EDIT can be swapped for ETH.
- **Earning and Distribution**: Contributors earn $EDIT for their work in reporting and verifying news.
- **Restaking Mechanism**: $EDIT holders can swap $EDIT for ETH and restake ETH on Ethereum for potential additional rewards, enhancing network security and commitment.
- **Burning Mechanism**: A portion of $EDIT is burned when swapped for ETH, introducing deflationary pressure over time.
- **Governance**: Holding $EDIT grants governance rights, potentially using quadratic or reputation-weighted voting for fair decision-making.
- **Reputation**: Non-transferable reputation scores (SBTs) may be implemented to influence voting power and rewards based on contribution quality and history.
- **Value Growth**: The value of $EDIT is intended to grow with the adoption, credibility, and overall success of the "Week in Ethereum News AI Edition" platform.
