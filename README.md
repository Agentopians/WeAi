## About

Week in Ethereum News AI Edition is a project developed during the ETH Global Agentic AI hackathon to continue the valuable service provided by Week in Ethereum News, which ceased operations at the end of 2024.  The original "Week in Ethereum News" was distributed through a popular Substack page and email list. Our system uses AI agents to curate, summarize, and deliver comprehensive weekly updates about the Ethereum ecosystem, including paid job postings from sponsors.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered news curation and summarization
- üì∞ Automated weekly newsletter generation
- üíº Integrated job posting system for sponsors
- üîç Quality control through AI moderation
- üìä Feedback-driven continuous improvement

## Architecture

Our system uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of the newsletter production pipeline. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information about each agent's role and responsibilities.
