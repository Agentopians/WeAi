# Technical Design

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design and architecture of the Week in Ethereum News AI Edition project. It provides details on the system components, data flow, and integration points.

## System Components

- **AI Agents**: Specialized agents for content curation, summarization, and moderation.
- **Database**: Stores news articles, job postings, and user data.
- **API**: Provides endpoints for external integrations and data access.
- **Web Interface**: User interface for managing content and job postings.

## Data Flow

1. **Content Ingestion**: News articles are collected and stored in the database.
2. **Content Processing**: AI agents process and categorize the content.
3. **Newsletter Generation**: Processed content is compiled into a newsletter format.
4. **Distribution**: The newsletter is distributed to subscribers via email.

## Integration Points

- **External APIs**: Used for fetching news articles and job postings.
- **Email Service**: Sends newsletters to subscribers.
- **Payment Gateway**: Handles job posting payments.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control is implemented for all system components.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Implement advanced ML models for better content summarization.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the system for handling increased data volume and user load.
