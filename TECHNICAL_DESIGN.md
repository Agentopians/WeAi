# Technical Design

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design and architecture of the Week in Ethereum News AI Edition project. It provides details on the system components, data flow, and integration points. The system follows an **AI-Agentic Journalism Workflow** for content creation, which includes stages for report submission, draft generation, verification, editorial review, and publication.  More details on this workflow can be found in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.  The project also implements a **Two-Token Model** ($EDIT and ETH) to incentivize participation and ensure economic sustainability, as described in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md). The project is designed with principles of verifiability in mind, drawing inspiration from 'Level 1 Agent' concepts and exploring potential future integration with verifiable computing technologies like Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs).

## System Components

- **AI Agents**:
    - **News Extractor Agent**: Implemented using web scraping techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, NLTK, spaCy) to extract relevant news from online sources, specifically "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem" on platforms like X/Twitter.
    - **News Verifier Agent**: Utilizes APIs from fact-checking services and integrates with EigenLayer Actively Validated Services (AVSs) for cryptographic verification of news content. May incorporate machine learning models (e.g., using TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) for source credibility analysis, sentiment analysis, and fake news detection. Operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure and reliable verification processes.
    - **Editorial Agent**: Provides an interface for human editorial review and content refinement.  This could be a simplified Content Management System (CMS) built with a framework like Flask or Django, offering tools for editing, fact-checking, and managing news content.
    - **Publisher Agent**: Responsible for publishing the finalized news to various platforms, including the "WaiE X account" (e.g., via X/Twitter API) and the "WaiE Website" (potentially using a web content API or direct database interaction).  Also handles newsletter distribution via email services.
- **Database**:  A persistent storage solution to store news articles, job postings, user data, and token-related information.  This could be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) depending on scalability requirements and data structure complexity.
- **API**:  A RESTful API built using frameworks like Flask, Django REST framework, or FastAPI to facilitate communication between AI agents, the web interface, and external services. Endpoints will include functionalities for news ingestion, content retrieval, job posting management, user authentication, and potentially token interactions.
- **Web Interface**:  A user-friendly web interface developed with a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Vue.js, or Angular.  Provides features for users to view newsletters, manage job postings, participate in governance (e.g., voting, proposals), and potentially interact with token-related functionalities (e.g., viewing $EDIT balances, claiming rewards).
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet or a compatible Layer-2 scaling solution (e.g., Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum).  Developed using Solidity and tools like Hardhat or Truffle.  Manage the $EDIT token (tokenomics, distribution), ETH restaking mechanisms, governance processes, and reward distribution to contributors.

## Data Flow

This section outlines the flow of information between system components, following the AI-Agentic Journalism workflow.

1.  **Data Source**: The flow begins with the **"Data Source"**: Information from "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem" is collected as the primary source of news and relevant information from the Ethereum ecosystem.
2.  **News Extraction**: The **News Extractor Agent** extracts relevant news and information from the "Data Source". This step corresponds to the "Report Submission & Draft Generation" stage of the AI-Agentic workflow.
3.  **News Verification with AVS**: The extracted information is sent to the **News Verifier Agent**. This agent, utilizing **EigenLayer AVS**, performs the "Verification Process" to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the information. This step includes interaction with AVS for cryptographic verification.
4.  **Editorial Review and Feedback Loop**: The **News Verifier Agent** may initiate a feedback loop with the **Editorial Agent** if additional editorial review is required during the verification process. The **Editorial Agent** performs the "Editorial Review", consulting "Archives" if necessary, and refines the verified content.
5.  **Archival Consultation**: During the "Editorial Review", the **Editorial Agent** may consult **Archives** to obtain historical context or additional information relevant to the news.
6.  **Publication**: Once the editorial review is complete, the **Editorial Agent** sends the finalized news to the **Publisher Agent**. The **Publisher Agent** handles "Publication", distributing the content through "WaiE X account" and "WaiE Website", as well as in the weekly newsletter.
7.  **Job Posting Payments**: Payments for job postings in ETH or stablecoins are processed and recorded. This process is independent of the main news flow but is an important component of the system.
8.  **$EDIT Token Distribution**: Rewards in $EDIT are distributed to contributors based on their roles and contributions, managed by smart contracts.
9.  **Governance Interactions**: $EDIT holders can participate in governance processes through the web interface, interacting with governance smart contracts.
10. **$EDIT - ETH Swapping & Restaking**: Mechanisms for swapping $EDIT to ETH and restaking ETH will be implemented, potentially through smart contracts and integrated into the web interface.

## Integration Points

- **External APIs**:
    - **X/Twitter API**: For the News Extractor Agent to monitor "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem".
    - **Fact-Checking APIs**: APIs from services providing fact-checking and source verification data for the News Verifier Agent.
    - **Email Service API (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun)**: For the Publisher Agent to distribute newsletters.
    - **Payment Gateway APIs**: For processing job posting payments in ETH or stablecoins.
- **EigenLayer AVS (Core Verification Service)**:  Central integration with EigenLayer Actively Validated Services for verifiable and cryptographically-backed news verification by the News Verifier Agent. This is a key component for ensuring the trustworthiness of the curated news.
- **Smart Contract Platform (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet or Layer 2)**:  For deploying and interacting with smart contracts related to the token model, governance, and reward distribution.
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Integration with DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) to facilitate $EDIT token trading and liquidity.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including API keys, user credentials, and potentially news content, is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption).
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented across all system components to manage permissions and access levels for different users and agents.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Smart contracts will undergo rigorous security audits by reputable firms to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before deployment. Secure coding practices will be enforced throughout smart contract development.
- **Token Security**: Secure mechanisms for $EDIT token minting, burning, and distribution will be implemented in smart contracts. Multi-signature wallets and secure key management practices will be used for operational security.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Security**: The TEE environment for the News Verifier Agent and Editorial Agent will be configured to ensure isolation and prevent unauthorized access or manipulation of the verification and editorial processes.
- **Verifiability and Transparency Considerations**:  The integration of EigenLayer AVS is a core security and transparency measure, providing verifiable evidence of the integrity of the news verification process.  This enhances user trust and the credibility of the news platform.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Implement more advanced ML models, such as transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT-2/3), for improved content summarization, topic modeling, and personalized news recommendations.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the system architecture and infrastructure for handling increased data volume, user traffic, and the number of AI agents. Explore horizontal scaling and cloud-based solutions.
- **Advanced Tokenomics Features**: Explore and implement more sophisticated tokenomic mechanisms, such as dynamic reward adjustments based on content quality and user engagement, refined $EDIT burning mechanisms, and advanced decentralized governance models (e.g., quadratic voting, conviction voting).
- **Optimization of Verification with AVS and Exploration of New Verification Capabilities**: Continuously optimize the integration with EigenLayer AVS to improve efficiency and reduce verification costs. Explore new AVS capabilities and other verifiable computing technologies to further enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of the AI agents and the news curation process.
