# Technical Design

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design and architecture of the Week in Ethereum News AI Edition project. It provides details on the system components, data flow, and integration points. The system follows an **AI-Agentic Journalism Workflow** for content creation, which includes stages for report submission, draft generation, verification, editorial review, and publication.  More details on this workflow can be found in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.  The project also implements a **Two-Token Model** ($EDIT and ETH) to incentivize participation and ensure economic sustainability, as described in [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md). The project is designed with principles of verifiability in mind, drawing inspiration from 'Level 1 Agent' concepts and exploring potential future integration with verifiable computing technologies like Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs).

## System Components

- **AI Agents**:
    - **News Extractor Agent**: Implemented using web scraping techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, NLTK, spaCy) to extract relevant news from online sources, specifically "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem" on platforms like X/Twitter.
    - **News Verifier Agent**: Utilizes APIs from fact-checking services and integrates with EigenLayer Actively Validated Services (AVSs) for cryptographic verification of news content. May incorporate machine learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) for source credibility analysis, sentiment analysis, and fake news detection. Operates within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure and reliable verification processes.
    - **Editorial Agent**: Provides an interface for human editorial review and content refinement.  This could be a simplified Content Management System (CMS) built with a framework like Flask or Django, offering tools for editing, fact-checking, and managing news content.
    - **Publisher Agent**: Responsible for publishing the finalized news to various platforms, including the "WaiE X account" (e.g., via X/Twitter API) and the "WaiE Website" (potentially using a web content API or direct database interaction).  Also handles newsletter distribution via email services.
- **Database**:  A persistent storage solution to store news articles, job postings, user data, and token-related information.  This could be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) depending on scalability requirements and data structure complexity.
- **API**:  A RESTful API built using frameworks like Flask, Django REST framework, or FastAPI to facilitate communication between AI agents, the web interface, and external services. Endpoints will include functionalities for news ingestion, content retrieval, job posting management, user authentication, and potentially token interactions.
- **Web Interface**:  A user-friendly web interface developed with a modern JavaScript framework such as React, Vue.js, or Angular.  Provides features for users to view newsletters, manage job postings, participate in governance (e.g., voting, proposals), and potentially interact with token-related functionalities (e.g., viewing $EDIT balances, claiming rewards).
- **Smart Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet or a compatible Layer-2 scaling solution (e.g., Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum).  Developed using Solidity and tools like Hardhat or Truffle.  Manage the $EDIT token (tokenomics, distribution), ETH restaking mechanisms, governance processes, and reward distribution to contributors.

## Data Flow

This section outlines the flow of information between system components, following the AI-Agentic Journalism workflow.

1.  **Data Source**: The flow begins with the **"Data Source"**: Information from "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem" is collected as the primary source of news and relevant information from the Ethereum ecosystem.
2.  **News Extraction**: The **News Extractor Agent** extracts relevant news and information from the "Data Source". This step corresponds to the "Report Submission & Draft Generation" stage of the AI-Agentic workflow.
3.  **News Verification with AVS**: The extracted information is sent to the **News Verifier Agent**. This agent, utilizing **EigenLayer AVS**, performs the "Verification Process" to ensure the accuracy and credibility of the information. This step includes interaction with AVS for cryptographic verification.
4.  **Editorial Review and Feedback Loop**: The **News Verifier Agent** may initiate a feedback loop with the **Editorial Agent** if additional editorial review is required during the verification process. The **Editorial Agent** performs the "Editorial Review", consulting "Archives" if necessary, and refines the verified content.
5.  **Archival Consultation**: During the "Editorial Review", the **Editorial Agent** may consult **Archives** to obtain historical context or additional information relevant to the news.
6.  **Publication**: Once the editorial review is complete, the **Editorial Agent** sends the finalized news to the **Publisher Agent**. The **Publisher Agent** handles "Publication", distributing the content through "WaiE X account" and "WaiE Website", as well as in the weekly newsletter.
7.  **Job Posting Payments**: Payments for job postings in ETH or stablecoins are processed and recorded. This process is independent of the main news flow but is an important component of the system.
8.  **$EDIT Token Distribution**: Rewards in $EDIT are distributed to contributors based on their roles and contributions, managed by smart contracts.
9.  **Governance Interactions**: $EDIT holders can participate in governance processes through the web interface, interacting with governance smart contracts.
10. **$EDIT - ETH Swapping & Restaking**: Mechanisms for swapping $EDIT to ETH and restaking ETH will be implemented, potentially through smart contracts and integrated into the web interface.

## Integration Points

- **Core AI Agent Integrations**:
    - **News Extractor Agent**: Integrates with **X/Twitter API** to monitor and extract data from "Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem". This is the primary data ingestion point for the news curation pipeline.
    - **News Verifier Agent**: Integrates with **Fact-Checking APIs** for source verification and fact validation.  Crucially, it also integrates with **EigenLayer AVS (Core Verification Service)** for verifiable and cryptographically-backed news verification, ensuring trust and transparency in the verification process.
    - **Editorial Agent**: Integrates with **Archives (Database)** to access historical news data and context for editorial review and content refinement.
    - **Publisher Agent**: Integrates with **Email Service APIs (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun)** for newsletter distribution and **WaiE Platform (API or Direct Database)** for website and X/Twitter account publishing.

- **Payment and Tokenomics Integrations**:

    - **Smart Contract Platform (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet or Layer 2)**:  For deploying and interacting with smart contracts related to the token model, governance, and reward distribution.
    - **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**: Integration with DEXs (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) to facilitate $EDIT token trading and liquidity, enabling swapping and restaking mechanisms.

- **External Data and Services**:
    - **"Top-1000 X accounts in Ethereum ecosystem" (Data Source)**:  Represents the external social media data source that the News Extractor Agent monitors.
    - **Fact-Checking APIs (External Verification Services)**: Represents external services that provide fact-checking and source verification data to the News Verifier Agent.
    - **EigenLayer AVS (External Verifiable Computing)**: Represents the external EigenLayer Actively Validated Service that provides verifiable computing capabilities to the News Verifier Agent.
    - **Beacon Chain Oracle (Succinct Telepathy)**: While not explicitly in "Integration Points" section, it's worth noting the system relies on a Beacon Chain Oracle (like Succinct Telepathy, as mentioned in `contracts/lib/eigenlayer-middleware/lib/eigenlayer-contracts/docs/core/EigenPodManager.md`) for verifiable state roots, especially for EigenLayer AVS interactions (though this might be abstracted within `eigensdk-js`).

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data, including API keys, user credentials, and news content, is encrypted both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (database encryption using AES-256 or similar). This protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented across all system components.  This ensures that only authorized users and agents can access specific functionalities and data, minimizing the risk of unauthorized actions or data leaks.  Permissions are strictly defined and enforced.
- **Smart Contract Security**: Smart contracts will undergo rigorous security audits by reputable firms specializing in blockchain security. Audits will be performed before deployment to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy attacks, gas limit issues). Secure coding practices and principles of least privilege are enforced during smart contract development.
- **Token Security**: Secure mechanisms for $EDIT token minting, burning, and distribution are implemented within audited smart contracts. Multi-signature wallets will be used for managing critical smart contract functions and treasury funds, requiring multiple authorized parties to approve transactions. Secure key management practices, including hardware wallets and secure key storage, will be enforced for operational security.
- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Security**:  The News Verifier Agent and Editorial Agent operate within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  TEE provides hardware-level isolation, creating secure enclaves to protect sensitive code and data from the untrusted operating system and other parts of the system. This significantly reduces the attack surface and protects the verification and editorial processes from manipulation.  Regular security assessments of the TEE configuration will be performed.
- **EigenLayer AVS for Verifiable Security**: The integration of EigenLayer AVS provides a crucial layer of verifiable security. AVS offers cryptographically-backed assurance of the integrity and unbiased operation of the News Verifier Agent.  This decentralized verification process enhances transparency and makes the news curation process more resistant to censorship and manipulation compared to traditional centralized systems.
- **Input Validation and Sanitization**: All inputs to the AI agents and the API are rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).  Input validation rules are defined and enforced at multiple layers of the system.
- **Security Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive security logging and monitoring are implemented across all system components.  Security logs are securely stored and regularly analyzed for anomaly detection and incident response.  Real-time alerts are configured for critical security events to enable rapid response to potential threats.
