# Technical Design

## Overview

This document outlines the technical design and architecture of the Week in Ethereum News AI Edition project. It provides details on the system components, data flow, and integration points. The system follows an **AI-Agentic Journalism Workflow** for content creation, which includes stages for report submission, draft generation, verification, editorial review, and publication.  More details on this workflow can be found in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## System Components

- **AI Agents**: Specialized agents for content curation, summarization, and moderation.
- **Database**: Stores news articles, job postings, and user data.
- **API**: Provides endpoints for external integrations and data access.
- **Web Interface**: User interface for managing content and job postings.

## Data Flow

1. **Content Ingestion**: News articles are collected and stored in the database as part of the "Report Submission" stage of the AI-Agentic Journalism Workflow.
2. **Content Processing**: AI agents process and categorize the content during the "Draft Generation" and "Verification Process" stages.
3. **Newsletter Generation**: Processed content is compiled into a newsletter format during the "Editorial Review" stage.
4. **Distribution**: The newsletter is distributed to subscribers via email in the "Publication" stage.

## Integration Points

- **External APIs**: Used for fetching news articles and job postings.
- **Email Service**: Sends newsletters to subscribers.
- **Payment Gateway**: Handles job posting payments.

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control is implemented for all system components.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning**: Implement advanced ML models for better content summarization.
- **Scalability**: Optimize the system for handling increased data volume and user load.
