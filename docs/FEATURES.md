## Tokenomics

- **Two-Token Model**: Utilizes $EDIT (Editorial Coin) and ETH for a balanced ecosystem.
    - **$EDIT (Editorial Coin)**: Used for rewarding contributors (reporters, verifiers), governance, and future utility within the platform.
    - **ETH (Restaking & Liquidity Layer)**:  ETH is used as a restaking and liquidity layer, providing economic security. $EDIT can be swapped for ETH.
- **Earning and Distribution**: Contributors earn $EDIT for their work in reporting and verifying news.
- **Restaking Mechanism**: $EDIT holders can swap $EDIT for ETH and restake ETH on Ethereum for potential additional rewards, enhancing network security and commitment.
- **Burning Mechanism**: A portion of $EDIT is burned when swapped for ETH, introducing deflationary pressure over time.
- **Governance**: Holding $EDIT grants governance rights, potentially using quadratic or reputation-weighted voting for fair decision-making.
- **Reputation**: Non-transferable reputation scores (SBTs) may be implemented to influence voting power and rewards based on contribution quality and history.
- **Value Growth**: The value of $EDIT is intended to grow with the adoption, credibility, and overall success of the "Week in Ethereum News AI Edition" platform.

## Verifiable AI Processes with AVS and TEE

We are enhancing the verifiability of our AI agents and news curation processes by drawing inspiration from 'Level 1 Agent' principles and leveraging technologies like Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This approach increases transparency and user trust in the platform by providing cryptographic assurance of the integrity of the news verification process.

## Substack and Email Newsletter Distribution

- Implement Substack page and email list distribution to mirror the original "Week in Ethereum News" delivery method.
- Automated newsletter publishing to Substack and email list.
