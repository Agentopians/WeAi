  1. Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
  ```
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  ```
  
  2. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  
  3. Build the contracts:
  ```
  make build-contracts
  ```
  
  4. NodeJs
  5. Install required modules:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
  
  > [!TIP]
  > This AVS employs the [eigensdk-js](https://github.com/zellular-xyz/eigensdk-js) to facilitate interaction with EigenLayer contracts and to aggregate BLS signatures.
  
  ## Running
  
  This simple session illustrates the basic flow of the AVS. The makefile commands are hardcoded for a single operator, but it's however easy to create new operator config files, and start more operators manually (see the actual commands that the makefile calls).
  
  Start anvil in a separate terminal:
  
  ```bash
  make start-anvil-chain-with-el-and-avs-deployed
  ```
  
  The above command starts a local anvil chain from a [saved state](./tests/anvil/avs-and-eigenlayer-deployed-anvil-state.json) with eigenlayer and incredible-squaring contracts already deployed (but no operator registered).
  
  Start the aggregator:
  
  ```bash
  make start-aggregator
  ```
  
  Register the operator with eigenlayer and incredible-squaring, and then start the process:
  
  ```bash
  make start-operator
  ```

  **Actions**
  - [ ] An action item list describing the work to be done
  - [ ] Link to all of the related tasks needed to complete the feature. See the [tasks](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/docs/blob/949bd6b4ddd0ef08880c6775c2d9a6222e2e7eb3/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md) template.
  - [ ] Include everything in the definition of done e.g. unit tests and documentation
  
  **Acceptance criteria**
  Acceptance criteria are the requirements that need to be met in order to mark a user story as complete. For example, if your user story is, "As a New Relic customer, I want to know how to interpret AI anomalies in order to monitor my site and protect myself against incidents," then the acceptance criteria would be: "A complete and published doc describing AI anomalies," and all related quality checks.

  # EigenLayer Middleware
  
  EigenLayer is a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum that enable restaking of assets to secure new services called AVSs (actively validated services). The core contracts that enable these features can be found in the [`eigenlayer-contracts` repo][core-repo].

  ## Documentation
  
  ### Basics
  
  To get a basic understanding of EigenLayer, check out [You Could've Invented EigenLayer](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/ycie/). Note that some of the document's content describes features that do not exist yet (like the Slasher). To understand more about how restakers and operators interact with EigenLayer, check out these guides:
  * [Restaking User Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide)
  * [Operator Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/operator-guides/operator-introduction)
  
  Most of this content is intro-level and describes user interactions with the EigenLayer core contracts, but it should give you a good enough starting point.

  ## BLSSignatureChecker
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |

  | [`OperatorStateRetriever.sol`](../src/OperatorStateRetriever.sol) | Singleton | None |
  
  `BLSSignatureChecker` and `OperatorStateRetriever` perform (respectively) the onchain and offchain portions of BLS signature validation for the aggregate of a quorum's registered Operators.
  
  The `OperatorStateRetriever` has various view methods intended to be called by offchain infrastructure in order to prepare a call to `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures`. These methods traverse the state histories kept by the various registry contracts (see [./RegistryCoordinator.md](./RegistryCoordinator.md)) to query states at specific block numbers.
  
  These historical states are then used within `BLSSignatureChecker` to validate a BLS signature formed from an aggregated subset of the Operators registered for one or more quorums at some specific block number.
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Onchain](#onchain)
  * [Offchain](#offchain)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  ---
  
  ### Onchain
  
  #### `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures`
  
  ```solidity
  function checkSignatures(
      bytes32 msgHash, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers,
      uint32 referenceBlockNumber, 
      NonSignerStakesAndSignature memory params
  )
      public 
      view
      returns (QuorumStakeTotals memory, bytes32)
  
  struct NonSignerStakesAndSignature {
      uint32[] nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices;
      BN254.G1Point[] nonSignerPubkeys;
      BN254.G1Point[] quorumApks;
      BN254.G2Point apkG2;
      BN254.G1Point sigma;
      uint32[] quorumApkIndices;
      uint32[] totalStakeIndices;
      uint32[][] nonSignerStakeIndices;
  }
  
  struct QuorumStakeTotals {
      uint96[] signedStakeForQuorum;
      uint96[] totalStakeForQuorum;
  }
  ```
  
  The goal of this method is to allow an AVS to validate a BLS signature formed from the aggregate pubkey ("apk") of Operators registered in one or more quorums at some `referenceBlockNumber`.
  
  Some notes on method parameters:
  * `msgHash` is the hash being signed by the apk. Note that the caller is responsible for ensuring `msgHash` is a hash! If someone can provide arbitrary input, it may be possible to tamper with signature verification.
  * `referenceBlockNumber` is the reason each registry contract keeps historical states: so that lookups can be performed on each registry's info at a particular block. This is important because Operators may sign some data on behalf of an AVS, then deregister from one or more of the AVS's quorums. Historical states allow signature validation to be performed against a "fixed point" in AVS/quorum history.
  * `quorumNumbers` is used to perform signature validation across one *or more* quorums. Also, Operators may be registered for more than one quorum - and for each quorum an Operator is registered for, that Operator's pubkey is included in that quorum's apk within the `BLSApkRegistry`. This means that, when calculating an apk across multiple `quorumNumbers`, Operators registered for more than one of these quorums will have their pubkey included more than once in the total apk.
  * `params` contains both a signature from all signing Operators, as well as several fields that identify registered, non-signing Operators. While non-signing Operators haven't contributed to the signature, but need to be accounted for because, as Operators registered for one or more signing quorums, their public keys are included in that quorum's apk. Essentially, in order to validate the signature, nonsigners' public keys need to be subtracted out from the total apk to derive the apk that actually signed the message.
  
  This method performs the following steps. Note that each step involves lookups of historical state from `referenceBlockNumber`, but the writing in this section will use the present tense because adding "at the `referenceBlockNumber`" everywhere gets confusing. Steps follow:
  1. Calculate the *total nonsigner apk*, an aggregate pubkey composed of all nonsigner pubkeys. For each nonsigner:
      * Query the `RegistryCoordinator` to get the nonsigner's registered quorums.
      * Multiply the nonsigner's pubkey by the number of quorums in `quorumNumbers` the nonsigner is registered for.
      * Add the result to the *total nonsigner apk*.
  2. Calculate the negative of the *total nonsigner apk*.
  3. For each quorum:
      * Query the `BLSApkRegistry` to get the *quorum apk*: the aggregate pubkey of all Operators registered for that quorum.
      * Add the *quorum apk* to the *total nonsigner apk*. This effectively subtracts out any pubkeys belonging to nonsigning Operators in the quorum, leaving only pubkeys of signing Operators. We'll call the result the *total signing apk*.
      * Query the `StakeRegistry` to get the total stake for the quorum.
      * For each nonsigner, if the nonsigner is registered for the quorum, query the `StakeRegistry` for their stake and subtract it from the total. This leaves only stake belonging to signing Operators.
  4. Use the `msgHash`, the *total signing apk*, `params.apkG2`, and `params.sigma` to validate the BLS signature.
  5. Return the total stake and signing stakes for each quorum, along with a hash identifying the `referenceBlockNumber` and non-signers 
  
  *Entry Points* (EigenDA):
  * Called by [`EigenDAServiceManager.confirmBatch`][eigenda-service-manager]
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Input validation:
      * Quorum-related fields MUST have equal lengths: `quorumNumbers`, `params.quorumApks`, `params.quorumApkIndices`, `params.totalStakeIndices`, `params.nonSignerStakeIndices`
      * Nonsigner-related fields MUST have equal lengths: `params.nonSignerPubkeys`, `params.nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices`
      * `referenceBlockNumber` MUST be less than `block.number`
      * `quorumNumbers` MUST be an ordered list of valid, initialized quorums
      * `params.nonSignerPubkeys` MUST ONLY contain unique pubkeys, in ascending order of their pubkey hash
  * For each quorum:
      * If stale stakes are forbidden (see [`BLSSignatureChecker.setStaleStakesForbidden`](#blssignaturecheckersetstalestakesforbidden)), check the last `quorumUpdateBlockNumber` is within `DelegationManager.minWithdrawalDelayBlocks` of `referenceBlockNumber`. This references a value in the EigenLayer core contracts - see [EigenLayer core docs][core-docs-dev] for more info.
      * Validate that each `params.quorumApks` corresponds to the quorum's apk at the `referenceBlockNumber`
  * For each historical state lookup, the `referenceBlockNumber` and provided index MUST point to a valid historical entry: 
      * `referenceBlockNumber` MUST come after the entry's `updateBlockNumber`
      * The entry's `nextUpdateBlockNumber` MUST EITHER be 0, OR greater than `referenceBlockNumber`

  ### Offchain
  
  These methods perform very gas-heavy lookups through various registry states, and are called by offchain infrastructure to construct calldata for a call to `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures`:
  * [`OperatorStateRetriever.getOperatorState (operatorId)`](#operatorstateretrievergetoperatorstate-operatorid)
  * [`OperatorStateRetriever.getOperatorState (quorumNumbers)`](#operatorstateretrievergetoperatorstate-quorumnumbers)
  * [`OperatorStateRetriever.getCheckSignaturesIndices`](#operatorstateretrievergetchecksignaturesindices)
  
  #### `OperatorStateRetriever.getOperatorState (operatorId)`
  
  ```solidity
  function getOperatorState(
      IRegistryCoordinator registryCoordinator, 
      bytes32 operatorId, 
      uint32 blockNumber
  ) 
      external 
      view 
      returns (uint256, Operator[][] memory)
  
  struct Operator {
      bytes32 operatorId;
      uint96 stake;
  }
  ```
  
  Traverses history in the `RegistryCoordinator`, `IndexRegistry`, and `StakeRegistry` to retrieve information on an Operator (given by `operatorId`) and the quorums they are registered for at a specific `blockNumber`. Returns:
  * `uint256`: a bitmap of the quorums the Operator was registered for at `blockNumber`
  * `Operator[][]`: For each of the quorums mentioned above, this is a list of the Operators registered for that quorum at `blockNumber`, containing each Operator's `operatorId` and `stake`.
  
  #### `OperatorStateRetriever.getOperatorState (quorumNumbers)`
  
  ```solidity
  function getOperatorState(
      IRegistryCoordinator registryCoordinator, 
      bytes memory quorumNumbers, 
      uint32 blockNumber
  ) 
      public 
      view 
      returns(Operator[][] memory)
  ```
  
  Traverses history in the `RegistryCoordinator`, `IndexRegistry`, and `StakeRegistry` to retrieve information on the Operator set registered for each quorum in `quorumNumbers` at `blockNumber`. Returns:
  * `Operator[][]`: For each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, this is a list of the Operators registered for that quorum at `blockNumber`, containing each Operator's `operatorId` and `stake`.
  
  #### `OperatorStateRetriever.getCheckSignaturesIndices`
  
  ```solidity
  function getCheckSignaturesIndices(
      IRegistryCoordinator registryCoordinator,
      uint32 referenceBlockNumber, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers, 
      bytes32[] calldata nonSignerOperatorIds
  )
      external 
      view 
      returns (CheckSignaturesIndices memory)
  
  struct CheckSignaturesIndices {
      uint32[] nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices;
      uint32[] quorumApkIndices;
      uint32[] totalStakeIndices;  
      uint32[][] nonSignerStakeIndices; // nonSignerStakeIndices[quorumNumberIndex][nonSignerIndex]
  }
  ```
  
  Traverses histories in the `RegistryCoordinator`, `IndexRegistry`, `StakeRegistry`, and `BLSApkRegistry` to retrieve information on one or more quorums' Operator sets and nonsigning Operators at a given `referenceBlockNumber`.
  
  The return values are all "indices," because of the linear historical state each registry keeps. Offchain code calls this method to compute indices into historical state, which later is leveraged for cheap lookups in `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures` (rather than traversing over the history during an onchain operation).
  
  For each quorum, this returns:
  * `uint32[] nonSignerQuorumBitmapIndices`: The indices in `RegistryCoordinator._operatorBitmapHistory` where each nonsigner's registered quorum bitmap can be found at `referenceBlockNumber`. Length is equal to the number of nonsigners included in `nonSignerOperatorIds`
  * `uint32[] quorumApkIndices`: The indices in `BLSApkRegistry.apkHistory` where the quorum's apk can be found at `referenceBlockNumber`. Length is equal to the number of quorums in `quorumNumbers`.
  * `uint32[] totalStakeIndices`: The indices in `StakeRegistry._totalStakeHistory` where each quorum's total stake can be found at `referenceBlockNumber`. Length is equal to the number of quorums in `quorumNumbers`.
  * `uint32[][] nonSignerStakeIndices`: For each quorum, a list of the indices of each nonsigner's `StakeRegistry.operatorStakeHistory` entry at `referenceBlockNumber`. Length is equal to the number of quorums in `quorumNumbers`, and each sub-list is equal in length to the number of nonsigners in `nonSignerOperatorIds` registered for that quorum at `referenceBlockNumber`

  ### System Configuration
  
  #### `BLSSignatureChecker.setStaleStakesForbidden`
  
  ```solidity
  function setStaleStakesForbidden(
      bool value
  ) 
      external 
      onlyCoordinatorOwner
  ```
  
  This method allows the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner to update `staleStakesForbidden` in the `BLSSignatureChecker`. If stale stakes are forbidden, `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures` will perform an additional check when querying each quorum's apk, Operator stakes, and total stakes.
  
  This additional check requires that each quorum was updated within a certain block window of the `referenceBlockNumber` passed into `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets `staleStakesForbidden` to `value`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner

  ## EigenLayer Middleware Docs
  
  EigenLayer AVSs ("actively validated services") are protocols that make use of EigenLayer's restaking primitives. AVSs are validated by EigenLayer Operators, who are backed by delegated restaked assets via the [EigenLayer core contracts][core-contracts-repo]. Each AVS will deploy or modify instances of the contracts in this repo to hook into the EigenLayer core contracts and ensure their service has an up-to-date view of its currently-registered Operators.
  
  **Currently, each AVS needs to implement one thing on-chain:** registration/deregistration conditions that define how an Operator registers for/deregisters from the AVS. This repo provides building blocks to support these functions.
  
  *Eventually,* the core contracts and this repo will be extended to cover other conditions, including:
  * payment conditions that define how an Operator is paid for the services it provides
  * slashing conditions that define "malicious behavior" in the context of the AVS, and the punishments for this behavior
  
  *... however, the design for these conditions is still in progress.*
  
  **Additional Note**: Although the goal of this repo is to eventually provide general-purpose building blocks for all kinds of AVSs, many of the contracts and design considerations were made to support EigenDA. When these docs provide examples, they will often cite EigenDA.
  
  For more information on EigenDA, check out the repo: [Layr-Labs/eigenda][eigenda-repo].

  ### Important Concepts
  
  ##### Quorums
  
  A quorum is a grouping and configuration of specific kinds of stake that an AVS considers when interacting with Operators. When Operators register for an AVS, they select one or more quorums within the AVS to register for. Depending on its configuration, each quorum evaluates a specific subset of the Operator's restaked tokens and uses this to determine a specific weight for the Operator for that quorum. This weight is ultimately used to determine when an AVS has reached consensus.
  
  The purpose of having a quorum is that an AVS can customize the makeup of its security offering by choosing which kinds of stake/security it would like to utilize.
  
  As an example, an AVS might want to support primarily native ETH stakers. It would do so by configuring a quorum to only weigh Operators that control shares belonging to the native eth strategy (defined in the core contracts).
  
  The Owner initializes quorums in the `RegistryCoordinator`, and may configure them further in both the `RegistryCoordinator` and `StakeRegistry` contracts. When quorums are initialized, they are assigned a unique, sequential quorum number.
  
  *Note:* For the most part, quorum numbers are passed between contracts as `bytes` arrays containing an ordered list of quorum numbers. However, when storing lists of quorums in state (and for other operations), these `bytes` arrays are converted to bitmaps using the [`BitmapUtils` library][bitmaputils-lib].
  
  ##### Strategies and Stake
  
  Each quorum has an associated list of `StrategyParams`, which the Owner can configure via the `StakeRegistry`.
  
  `StrategyParams` define pairs of strategies and multipliers for the quorum:
  * Strategies refer to the `DelegationManager` in the EigenLayer core contracts, which tracks shares delegated to each Operator for each supported strategy. Basically, a strategy is a wrapper around an underlying token - either an LST or Native ETH.
  * Multipliers determine the relative weight given to shares belonging to the corresponding strategy.
  
  When the `StakeRegistry` updates its view of an Operator's stake for a given quorum, it queries the `DelegationManager` to get the Operator's shares in each of the quorum's strategies and applies the multiplier to the returned share count.
  
  For more information on the `DelegationManager`, see the [EigenLayer core docs][core-docs-dev].
  
  ##### Operator Sets and Churn
  
  Quorums define a maximum Operator count as well as parameters that determine when a new Operator can replace an existing Operator when this max count is reached. The process of replacing an existing Operator when the max count is reached is called "churn," and requires a signature from the Churn Approver.
  
  These definitions are contained in a quorum's `OperatorSetParam`, which the Owner can configure via the `RegistryCoordinator`. A quorum's `OperatorSetParam` defines both a max Operator count, as well as stake thresholds that the incoming and existing Operators need to meet to qualify for churn.
  
  *Additional context*:
  
  Currently for EigenDA, the max Operator count is 200. This maximum exists because EigenDA requires that completed "jobs" validate a signature by the aggregate BLS pubkey of the Operator set over some job parameters. Although an aggregate BLS pubkey's signature should have a fixed cost no matter the number of Operators, it may be the case that not all Operators sign off on a job.
  
  When this happens, EigenDA needs to provide a list of the pubkeys of the non-signers to subtract them out from the quorum's aggregate pubkey ("Apk"). The limit of 200 Operators keeps the gas costs reasonable in a worst case scenario. See `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures` for this part of the implementation.
  
  In order to prevent the Operator set from getting calcified, the churn mechanism was introduced to allow Operators to be replaced in some cases. Future work is being done to increase the max Operator count and refine the churn mechanism.
  
  ##### State Histories
  
  Many of the contracts in this repo keep histories of states over time. Generally, you'll see structs that look like this:
  
  ```solidity
  struct ValueUpdate {
      Value value;
      uint32 updateBlockNumber;     // when the value started being valid
      uint32 nextUpdateBlockNumber; // when the value stopped being valid (or 0, if the value is still valid)
  }
  ```
  
  These histories are used by offchain code to query state at particular blocks, and are ultimately used to validate specific actions on-chain. See the [`BLSSignatureChecker` section](#blssignaturechecker) below.
  
  ##### Hooking Into EigenLayer Core
  
  The main thing that links an AVS to the EigenLayer core contracts is that when EigenLayer Operators register/deregister with an AVS, the AVS calls these functions in EigenLayer core:
  * [`AVSDirectory.registerOperatorToAVS`][core-registerToAVS]
  * [`AVSDirectory.deregisterOperatorFromAVS`][core-deregisterFromAVS]
  
  These methods ensure that the Operator registering with the AVS is also registered as an Operator in EigenLayer core. In this repo, these methods are called by the `ServiceManagerBase`.
  
  Eventually, Operator slashing and payment for services will be part of the middleware/core relationship, but these features aren't implemented yet and their design is a work in progress.
  
  ### System Components
  
  #### Service Manager
  
  | Code | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`ServiceManagerBase.sol`](../src/ServiceManagerBase.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The Service Manager contract serves as the AVS's address relative to EigenLayer core contracts. When Operators register for/deregister from the AVS, the Service Manager forwards this request to the DelegationManager (see [Hooking Into EigenLayer Core](#hooking-into-eigenlayer-core) above).
  
  It also contains a few convenience methods used to query Operator information by the frontend.
  
  See full documentation in [`ServiceManagerBase.md`](./ServiceManagerBase.md).
  
  #### Registries
  
  | Code | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`RegistryCoordinator.sol`](../src/RegistryCoordinator.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`BLSApkRegistry.sol`](../src/BLSApkRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`StakeRegistry.sol`](../src/StakeRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`IndexRegistry.sol`](../src/IndexRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `RegistryCoordinator` keeps track of which quorums exist and have been initialized. It is also the primary entry point for Operators as they register for and deregister from an AVS's quorums.
  
  When Operators register or deregister, the registry coordinator updates that Operator's currently-registered quorums, and pushes the registration/deregistration to each of the three registries it controls:
  * `BLSApkRegistry`: tracks the aggregate BLS pubkey hash for the Operators registered to each quorum. Also maintains a history of these aggregate pubkey hashes.
  * `StakeRegistry`: interfaces with the EigenLayer core contracts to determine the weight of Operators according to their stake and each quorum's configuration. Also maintains a history of these weights.
  * `IndexRegistry`: assigns indices to Operators within each quorum, and tracks historical indices and Operators per quorum. Used primarily by offchain infrastructure to fetch ordered lists of Operators in quorums.
  
  Both the registry coordinator and each of the registries maintain historical state for the specific information they track. This historical state tracking can be used to query state at a particular block, which is primarily used in offchain infrastructure.
  
  See full documentation for the registry coordinator in [`RegistryCoordinator.md`](./RegistryCoordinator.md), and for each registry in [`registries/`](./registries/).
  
  #### BLSSignatureChecker
  
  | Code | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`BLSSignatureChecker.sol`](../src/BLSSignatureChecker.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`OperatorStateRetriever.sol`](../src/OperatorStateRetriever.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The BLSSignatureChecker verifies signatures made by the aggregate pubkeys ("Apk") of Operators in one or more quorums. The primary function, `checkSignatures`, is called by an AVS when confirming that a given message hash is signed by Operators belonging to one or more quorums.
  
  The `OperatorStateRetriever` is used by offchain code to query the `RegistryCoordinator` (and its registries) for information that will ultimately be passed into `BLSSignatureChecker.checkSignatures`.
  
  See full documentation for both of these contracts in [`BLSSignatureChecker.md`](./BLSSignatureChecker.md).

  ## RegistryCoordinator
  
  | File | Type | Proxy? |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`RegistryCoordinator.sol`](../src/RegistryCoordinator.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `RegistryCoordinator` has three primary functions:
  1. It is the primary entry and exit point for operators as they register for and deregister from quorums, and manages registration and deregistration in the `BLSApkRegistry`, `StakeRegistry`, and `IndexRegistry`. It also hooks into the EigenLayer core contracts, updating the core `DelegationManager` when an Operator registers/deregisters.
  2. It allows anyone to update the current stake of any registered operator
  3. It allows the Owner to initialize and configure new quorums
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Registering and Deregistering](#registering-and-deregistering)
  * [Updating Registered Operators](#updating-registered-operators)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  #### Roles
  
  * Owner: a permissioned role that can create and configure quorums as well as manage other roles
  * Ejector: a permissioned role that can forcibly eject an operator from a quorum via `RegistryCoordinator.ejectOperator`
  * Churn Approver: a permissioned role that signs off on operator churn in `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  ---    
  
  ### Registering and Deregistering
  
  These methods allow operators to register for/deregister from one or more quorums, and are the primary entry points to the middleware contracts as a whole:
  * [`registerOperator`](#registeroperator)
  * [`registerOperatorWithChurn`](#registeroperatorwithchurn)
  * [`deregisterOperator`](#deregisteroperator)
  * [`ejectOperator`](#ejectoperator)
  
  #### `registerOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperator(
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers,
      string calldata socket,
      IBLSApkRegistry.PubkeyRegistrationParams calldata params,
      SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory operatorSignature
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_REGISTER_OPERATOR)
  ```
  
  Registers the caller as an Operator for one or more quorums, as long as registration doesn't place any quorum's operator count above the configured cap. This method updates the Operator's current and historical bitmap of registered quorums, and forwards a call to each of the registry contracts:
  * `BLSApkRegistry.registerOperator`
  * `StakeRegistry.registerOperator`
  * `IndexRegistry.registerOperator`
  
  If the Operator has never registered for any of this AVS's quorums before, they need to register a BLS public key to participate in AVS signing events. In this case, this method will automatically pass `params` to the `BLSApkRegistry` to perform public key registration. The registered pubkey hash becomes the Operator's unique operator id, used to identify them in many places in the middleware contracts.
  
  If the Operator was not currently registered for any quorums, this method will register the Operator to the AVS in the EigenLayer core contracts via the `ServiceManagerBase`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * If the Operator has never registered for the AVS before:
      * Registers their BLS pubkey in the `BLSApkRegistry` (see [`BLSApkRegistry.registerBLSPublicKey`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#registerblspublickey))
  * If the Operator was not currently registered for any quorums: 
      * Updates their status to `REGISTERED`
      * Registers them in the core contracts (see [`ServiceManagerBase.registerOperatorToAVS`](./ServiceManagerBase.md#registeroperatortoavs))
  * Adds the new quorums to the Operator's current registered quorums, and updates the Operator's bitmap history
  * See [`BLSApkRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  * See [`StakeRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  * See [`IndexRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/IndexRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_REGISTER_OPERATOR`
  * Caller MUST have a valid operator ID in the `BLSApkRegistry`
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST be an ordered array of quorum numbers, with no entry exceeding the current `quorumCount`
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST contain at least one valid quorum
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST NOT contain any quorums the Operator is already registered for
  * If the Operator was not currently registered for any quorums:
      * See [`ServiceManagerBase.registerOperatorToAVS`](./ServiceManagerBase.md#registeroperatortoavs)
  * See [`BLSApkRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  * See [`StakeRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  * See [`IndexRegistry.registerOperator`](./registries/IndexRegistry.md#registeroperator)
  * For each quorum being registered for, the Operator's addition MUST NOT put the total number of operators registered for the quorum above the quorum's configured `maxOperatorCount`
  
  #### `registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperatorWithChurn(
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers, 
      string calldata socket,
      IBLSApkRegistry.PubkeyRegistrationParams calldata params,
      OperatorKickParam[] calldata operatorKickParams,
      SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory churnApproverSignature,
      SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory operatorSignature
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_REGISTER_OPERATOR)
  ```
  
  This method performs similar steps to `registerOperator` above, except that for each quorum where the new Operator total exceeds the `maxOperatorCount`, the `operatorKickParams` are used to deregister a current Operator to make room for the new one.
  
  This operation requires a valid signature from the Churn Approver. Additionally, the incoming and outgoing Operators must meet these requirements:
  * The new Operator's stake must be greater than the old Operator's stake by a factor given by the quorum's configured `kickBIPsOfOperatorStake`
  * The old Operator's stake must be lower than the total stake for the quorum by a factor given by the quorum's configured `kickBIPsOfTotalStake`
  
  *Effects*:
  * The new Operator is registered for one or more quorums (see `registerOperator` above)
  * For any quorum where registration causes the operator count to exceed `maxOperatorCount`, the Operator selected to be replaced is deregistered (see `deregisterOperator` below)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_REGISTER_OPERATOR`
  * The `churnApproverSignature` MUST be a valid, unexpired signature from the Churn Approver over the Operator's id and the `operatorKickParams`
  * The old and new Operators MUST meet the stake requirements described above
  * See `registerOperator` above
  * See `deregisterOperator` below
  
  #### `deregisterOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function deregisterOperator(
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DEREGISTER_OPERATOR)
  ```
  
  Allows an Operator to deregister themselves from one or more quorums.
  
  *Effects*:
  * If the Operator is no longer registered for any quorums:
      * Updates their status to `DEREGISTERED`
      * Deregisters them in the core contracts (see [`ServiceManagerBase.deregisterOperatorFromAVS`](./ServiceManagerBase.md#deregisteroperatorfromavs))
  * Removes the new quorums from the Operator's current registered quorums, and updates the Operator's bitmap history
  * See [`BLSApkRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  * See [`StakeRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  * See [`IndexRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/IndexRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_DEREGISTER_OPERATOR`
  * The Operator MUST currently be in the `REGISTERED` status (i.e. registered for at least one quorum)
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST be an ordered array of quorum numbers, with no entry exceeding the current `quorumCount`
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST contain at least one valid quorum
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST ONLY contain bits that are also set in the Operator's current registered quorum bitmap
  * See [`ServiceManagerBase.deregisterOperatorFromAVS`](./ServiceManagerBase.md#deregisteroperatorfromavs)
  * See [`BLSApkRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  * See [`StakeRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  * See [`IndexRegistry.deregisterOperator`](./registries/IndexRegistry.md#deregisteroperator)
  
  #### `ejectOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function ejectOperator(
      address operator, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      external 
      onlyEjector
  ```
  
  Allows the Ejector to forcibly deregister an Operator from one or more quorums.
  
  *Effects*:
  * See `deregisterOperator` above
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Ejector
  * See `deregisterOperator` above
  
  ---
  
  ### Updating Registered Operators
  
  These methods concern Operators that are currently registered for at least one quorum:
  * [`updateOperators`](#updateoperators)
  * [`updateOperatorsForQuorum`](#updateoperatorsforquorum)
  * [`updateSocket`](#updatesocket)
  
  #### `updateOperators`
  
  ```solidity
  function updateOperators(
      address[] calldata operators
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_UPDATE_OPERATOR)
  ```
  
  Allows anyone to update the contracts' view of one or more Operators' stakes. For each currently-registered `operator`, this method calls `StakeRegistry.updateOperatorStake`, triggering an update of that Operator's stake. 
  
  The `StakeRegistry` returns a bitmap of quorums where the Operator no longer meets the minimum stake required for registration. The Operator is then deregistered from those quorums.
  
  *Effects*:
  * See [`StakeRegistry.updateOperatorStake`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#updateoperatorstake)
  * For any quorums where the Operator no longer meets the minimum stake, they are deregistered (see `deregisterOperator` above).
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_UPDATE_OPERATOR`
  * See [`StakeRegistry.updateOperatorStake`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#updateoperatorstake)
  
  #### `updateOperatorsForQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function updateOperatorsForQuorum(
      address[][] calldata operatorsPerQuorum,
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_UPDATE_OPERATOR)
  ```
  
  Can be called by anyone to update the stake of ALL Operators in one or more quorums simultaneously. This method works similarly to `updateOperators` above, but with the requirement that, for each quorum being updated, the respective `operatorsPerQuorum` passed in is the complete set of Operators currently registered for that quorum.
  
  This method also updates each quorum's `quorumUpdateBlockNumber`, signifying that the quorum's entire Operator set was updated at the current block number. (This is used by the `BLSSignatureChecker` to ensure that signature and stake validation is performed on up-to-date stake.)
  
  *Effects*:
  * See `updateOperators` above
  * Updates each quorum's `quorumUpdateBlockNumber` to the current block
  * For any quorums where the Operator no longer meets the minimum stake, they are deregistered (see `deregisterOperator` above).
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_UPDATE_OPERATOR`
  * See `updateOperators` above
  * `quorumNumbers` MUST be an ordered array of quorum numbers, with no entry exceeding the current `quorumCount`
  * All `quorumNumbers` MUST correspond to valid, initialized quorums
  * `operatorsPerQuorum` and `quorumNumbers` MUST have the same lengths
  * Each entry in `operatorsPerQuorum` MUST contain an order list of the currently-registered Operator addresses in the corresponding quorum
  * See [`StakeRegistry.updateOperatorStake`](./registries/StakeRegistry.md#updateoperatorstake)
  
  #### `updateSocket`
  
  ```solidity
  function updateSocket(string memory socket) external
  ```
  
  Allows a registered Operator to emit an event, updating their socket.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Emits an `OperatorSocketUpdate` event
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be a registered Operator
  
  ---
  
  ### System Configuration
  
  These methods are used by the Owner to configure the `RegistryCoordinator`:
  * [`createQuorum`](#createquorum)
  * [`setOperatorSetParams`](#setoperatorsetparams)
  * [`setChurnApprover`](#setchurnapprover)
  * [`setEjector`](#setejector)
  
  #### `createQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function createQuorum(
      OperatorSetParam memory operatorSetParams,
      uint96 minimumStake,
      IStakeRegistry.StrategyParams[] memory strategyParams
  ) 
      external
      virtual 
      onlyOwner
  ```
  
  Allows the Owner to initialize a new quorum with the given configuration. The new quorum is assigned a sequential quorum number.
  
  The new quorum is also initialized in each of the registry contracts.
  
  *Effects*:
  * `quorumCount` is incremented by 1

  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Owner
  * Quorum count before creation MUST be less than `MAX_QUORUM_COUNT`
  * See [`BLSApkRegistry.initializeQuorum`](./registries/BLSApkRegistry.md#initializequorum)

      OperatorSetParam memory operatorSetParams
  ) 
      external 
      onlyOwner 
      quorumExists(quorumNumber)
  ```
  
  Allows the Owner to update an existing quorum's `OperatorSetParams`, which determine:
  * `maxOperatorCount`: The max number of operators that can be in this quorum
  * `kickBIPsOfOperatorStake`: The basis points a new Operator needs over an old Operator's stake to replace them in `registerOperatorWithChurn`
  * `kickBIPsOfTotalStake`: The basis points a replaced Operator needs under the quorum's total stake to be replaced in `registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Updates the quorum's `OperatorSetParams`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Owner
  * `quorumNumber` MUST correspond to an existing, initialized quorum
  
  #### `setChurnApprover`
  
  ```solidity
  function setChurnApprover(address _churnApprover) external onlyOwner
  ```
  
  Allows the Owner to update the Churn Approver address.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Updates the Churn Approver address
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Owner
  
  #### `setEjector`
  
  ```solidity
  function setEjector(address _ejector) external onlyOwner
  ```
  
  Allows the Owner to update the Ejector address.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Updates the Ejector address
  
  *Requirements*:

  ## ServiceManagerBase
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`ServiceManagerBase.sol`](../src/ServiceManagerBase.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `ServiceManagerBase` represents the AVS's address relative to EigenLayer core. When registering or deregistering an operator from an AVS, the AVS's `ServiceManagerBase` communicates this change to the core contracts, allowing the core contracts to maintain an up-to-date view on operator registration status with various AVSs.
  
  *As of M2*:
  * Currently, this contract is used by the `AVSDirectory` to keep track of operator registration and deregistration. Eventually, this relationship will be expanded to allow operators to opt in to slashing and payments for services.

      ISignatureUtils.SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory operatorSignature
  ) 
      public

  When the `RegistryCoordinator` registers an operator for an AVS and they were not previously registered, it calls this method on `ServiceManagerBase`, which forwards the call to the EigenLayer core contract, the `AVSDirectory`.

  # Purpose
  This document aims to describe and summarize how actively validated services (AVSs) building on EigenLayer interact with the core EigenLayer protocol. Currently, this doc explains how AVS developers can use the APIs for: 
  - enabling operators to opt-in to the AVS,
  - enabling operators to opt-out (withdraw stake) from the AVS,
  - enabling operators to continuously update their commitments to middlewares, and
  - enabling AVS to freeze operators for the purpose of slashing (the corresponding unfreeze actions are determined by the veto committee).
  
  We are currently in the process of implementing the API for payment flow from AVSs to operators in EigenLayer. Details of this API will be added to this document in the near future.
  
  The following figure summarizes scope of this document:

  # Introduction
  In designing EigenLayer, the EigenLabs team aspired to make minimal assumptions about the structure of AVSs built on top of it. If you are getting started looking at [EigenLayer][eigenlayer-repo-link]'s codebase, the `Slasher.sol` contains most of the logic that actually mediates the interactions between EigenLayer and AVSs. This repo contains code that can be extended, used directly, or consulted as a reference in building an AVS on top of EigenLayer. Note that there will be a single, EigenLayer-owned, `Slasher.sol` contract, but all the `middleware` contracts are AVS-specific and need to be deployed separately by AVS teams.
  
  ## Important Terminology
  - **Tasks** - A task in EigenLayer is the smallest unit of work that operators commit to perform when serving an AVS. These tasks may be associated with one or more slashing conditions applicable to the AVS. 
  - **Strategies** - A strategy in EigenLayer is a contract that holds staker deposits, i.e. it controls one or more asset(s) that can be restaked. At launch EigenLayer will feature only simple strategies which may hold a single token. However, EigenLayer's strategy design is flexible and open, and in the future strategies could be deployed which implement more complex logic, including DeFi integrations. 
  - **Quorums** - A quorum in EigenLayer is a grouping of specific kinds of stake who opt into an AVS while satisfying a particular trait. Examples of such trait could be stETH stakers or native stakers.  The purpose of having a quorum is that an AVS can customize the makeup of their security offering by choosing which kinds of stake/security they would like to utilize.  
  
  # Key Design Considerations
  1. *Decomposition into "Tasks"*: <br/>
      EigenLayer assumes that an AVS manages tasks that are executed over time by a registered operator. Each task is associated with the time period during which the AVS's operators' stakes are placed "at stake", i.e. potentially subject to slashing. Examples of tasks could be:
      - Hosting and serving a “DataStore” in the context of EigenDA
      - Posting a state root of another blockchain for a bridge service
  
  2. *Stake is "At Stake" on Tasks for a Finite Duration*: <br/>
      It is assumed that every task (eventually) resolves. Each operator places their stake in EigenLayer “at stake” on the tasks that they perform. In order to “release” the stake (e.g. so the operator can withdraw their funds), these tasks need to eventually resolve. It is RECOMMENDED, but not required that a predefined duration is specified in the AVS contract for each task. As a guideline, the EigenLabs team believes that the duration of a task should be aligned with the longest reasonable duration that would be acceptable for an operator to keep funds “at stake”. An AVS builder should recognize that extending the duration of a task may impose significant negative externalities on the stakers of EigenLayer, and may disincentivize operators from opting-in to serving their application (so that they can attract more delegated stake).
  
  3. *Services Slash Only Objectively Attributable Behavior*: <br/>
      EigenLayer is built to support slashing as a result of an on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable action. An AVS SHOULD slash in EigenLayer only for such provable and attributable behavior. It is expected that operators will be very hesitant to opt-in to services that slash for other types of behavior, and other services may even choose to exclude operators who have opted-in to serving one or more AVSs with such “subjective slashing conditions”, as these slashing conditions present a significant challenge for risk modeling, and may be perceived as more dangerous in general. Some examples of on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable behavior: 
      - double-signing a block in Ethereum, but NOT inactivity leak; 
      - proofs-of-custody in EigenDA, but NOT a node ceasing to serve data; 
      - a node in a light-node-bridge AVS signing an invalid block from another chain.
  
  4. *Single Point-of-Interaction for Services and EigenLayer*: <br/>
      It is assumed that services have a single contract that coordinates the service’s communications sent to EigenLayer. This contract – referred to as the ServiceManager – informs EigenLayer of operator registration, updates, and deregistration, as well as signaling to EigenLayer when an operator should be slashed (frozen). An AVS has full control over how it splits the actual logic involved, but is expected to route all calls to EigenLayer through a single contract. While technically possible, an AVS SHOULD NOT use multiple contracts to interact with EigenLayer. An AVS architecture using multiple contracts to interact with EigenLayer will impose additional burden on stakers in EigenLayer when withdrawing stake.
  
  ## Integration with EigenLayer Contracts:
  In this section, we will explain various API interfaces that EigenLayer provides which are essential for AVSs to integrate with EigenLayer. 
  
  ### *Opting into AVS*
  In order for any EigenLayer operator to be able to opt-in to an AVS, EigenLayer provides two interfaces: `optIntoSlashing(..)` and `recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)`. The sequential flow for opting into an AVS using these functions is as follows:
  1. The operator first opts into slashing by calling  `Slasher.optIntoSlashing(..)`, where it has to specify the address of the AVS's ServiceManager contract in the argument. This step results in the operator giving permission to the AVS's ServiceManager contract to slash the operator via EigenLayer, if the operator is ever proven to have engaged in adversarial behavior while responding to the AVS's task. A successful call to  `Slasher.optIntoSlashing(..)` emits the `OptedIntoSlashing(..)` event.
  2. Next, the operator needs to register with the AVS on chain via an AVS-specific registry contract (see [this][middleware-guide-link] section for examples). To integrate with EigenLayer, the AVS's Registry contract provides a registration endpoint that calls on the AVS's `ServiceManager.recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)` which in turn calls `Slasher.recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)`. On successful execution of this function call, the event `MiddlewareTimesAdded(..)` is emitted and the operator has to start serving the tasks from the AVS.
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow: 
  ![Operator opting-in](../images/operator_opting.png)
  
  ### *Recording Stake Updates*
  EigenLayer is a dynamic system where stakers and operators are constantly adjusting amounts of stake delegated via the system. It is therefore imperative for an AVS to be aware of any changes to stake delegated to its operators. In order to facilitate this, EigenLayer offers the `Slasher.recordStakeUpdate(..)`.
  
  Let us illustrate the usage of this facility with an example: A staker has delegated to an operator, who has opted-in to serving an AVS. Whenever the staker withdraws some or all of its stake from EigenLayer, this withdrawal affects all the AVSs uniformly that the staker's delegated operator is participating in. The series of steps for withdrawing stake is as follows:
   - The staker queues their withdrawal request with EigenLayer. The staker can place this request by calling  `StrategyManager.queueWithdrawal(..)`.
   - The operator, noticing an upcoming change in their delegated stake, notifies the AVS about this change. To do this, the operator triggers the AVS to call the `ServiceManager.recordStakeUpdate(..)` which in turn accesses `Slasher.recordStakeUpdate(..)`.  On successful execution of this call, the event `MiddlewareTimesAdded(..)` is emitted.
  - The AVS provider now is aware of the change in stake, and the staker can eventually complete their withdrawal.  Refer [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/master/docs/EigenLayer-withdrawal-flow.md) for more details
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow: 
  ![Stake update](../images/staker_withdrawing.png)
  
  ### *Deregistering from AVS*
  In order for any EigenLayer operator to be able to de-register from an AVS, EigenLayer provides the interface `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility(..)`. Essentially, in order for an operator to deregister from an AVS, the operator has to call `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility(..)`  via the AVS's ServiceManager contract. It is important to note that the latest block number until which the operator is required to serve tasks for the service must be known by the service and included in the ServiceManager's call to `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility`.
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow in which the operator calls the `deregister(..)` function in a sample Registry contract.
  ![Operator deregistering](../images/operator_deregister.png)
  
  ### *Slashing*
  As mentioned above, EigenLayer is built to support slashing as a result of an on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable action. In order for an AVS to be able to slash an operator in an objective manner, the AVS needs to deploy a DisputeResolution contract which anyone can call to raise a challenge against an EigenLayer operator for its adversarial action. On successful challenge, the DisputeResolution contract calls `ServiceManager.freezeOperator(..)`; the ServiceManager in turn calls `Slasher.freezeOperator(..)` to freeze the operator in EigenLayer. EigenLayer's Slasher contract emits a `OperatorFrozen(..)` event whenever an operator is (successfully) frozen
  
  
  ## Quick Start Guide to Build AVS Contracts:
  The EigenLayer team has built this repo as a set of reusable and extensible contracts for use in AVSs built on top of EigenLayer, which comprises code that can be extended, used directly, or consulted as a reference in building AVS on top of EigenLayer. There are several basic contracts that all AVS-specific contracts can be built on:
  - The *VoteWeigherBase contract* tracks an operator’s “weight” in a given quorum, across all strategies that are associated with that quorum.  This contract also manages which strategies are in each quorum - this includes functionalities for both adding and removing strategies, as well as changing strategy weights.  
  - The *RegistryBase contract* is a basic registry contract that can be used to track operators opted-into running an AVS.  Importantly, this base registry contract assumes a maximum of two quorums, where each quorum represents an aggregation of a certain type of stake. 
  
  Furthermore, it’s expected that many AVSs will require a quorum of registered operators to sign on commitments.  To this end, the EigenLabs team has developed a set of contracts designed to optimize the cost of checking signatures through the use of a BLS aggregate signature scheme:
  ### BLSPublicKeyCompendium
  This contract allows each Ethereum address to register a unique BLS public key; a single BLSPublicKeyCompendium contract can be shared amongst all AVSs using BLS signatures. <br/>
  ### BLSRegistry
  This contract builds upon lower-level (RegistryBase and VoteWeigherBase) contracts, to allow users of EigenLayer to register as operators for a single AVS. Each AVS’s BLSRegistry keeps a historic record of the Aggregate Public Key (APK) of all operators of the AVS. To allow proper encoding of data and aggregation of signatures while avoiding race conditions (e.g. from operators registering or deregistering, causing the current APK to change), each task defines a referenceBlockNumber, which may be briefly in the past. The BLSRegistry defines an optional whitelister role, which controls whether or not the whitelist is enabled and can edit the whitelist. If the whitelist is enabled, then only addresses that have been whitelisted may opt-in to serving the AVS. <br/>   
  
  In addition, the BLSRegistry (technically the lower-level RegistryBase which the BLSRegistry inherits from) defines a “minimum stake” for the quorum(s). An operator can only register for the AVS if they meet the minimum requirement for at least one quorum. By default the `ServiceManager.owner()` has the ability to change the minimum stake requirement(s). Each BLSRegistry defines one or two “quorums”; each operator for the AVS may have stake in EigenLayer that falls into either (or both) quorum(s). Each quorum is essentially defined by two vectors: a vector of “Strategies” of interest (in practice this ends up being tokens of interest) and a vector of “weights” or “multipliers”, which define whether certain strategies are weighed more heavily than others within the quorum (e.g. if the AVS desires to give 2x power to a specific token over another token). In the contract code these vectors are condensed into a single array of `StrategyAndWeightingMultiplier` structs. The `ServiceManager.owner()` has the ability to edit these arrays at will.
  
  ### BLSSignatureChecker
  When signatures have been aggregated, they can be submitted to the BLSSignatureChecker, an optimized contract designed expressly for verifying quorums of BLS signers. The caller MUST provide a small amount of data corresponding to the task to be confirmed, the aggregate signature itself, and a bit of data for each non-signer, that is, the caller MUST provide data for each operator registered for the service for whom their signature has not been aggregated. The BLSSignatureChecker ultimately returns both the total stake that was present at the specified block number (i.e. the sum of all operator’s stakes) and the total stake that signed; these amounts can then be checked against a quorum condition (e.g. requiring ⅔ stake to sign) before the task is ultimately confirmed.

  ## BLSApkRegistry
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`BLSApkRegistry.sol`](../../src/BLSApkRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `BLSApkRegistry` tracks the current aggregate BLS pubkey for all Operators registered to each quorum, and keeps a historical record of each quorum's aggregate BLS pubkey hash. This contract makes heavy use of the `BN254` library to perform various operations on the BN254 elliptic curve (see [`BN254.sol`](../../src/libraries/BN254.sol)).
  
  Each time an Operator registers for a quorum, its BLS pubkey is added to that quorum's `currentApk`. Each time an Operator deregisters from a quorum, its BLS pubkey is subtracted from that quorum's `currentApk`. This contract maintains a history of the hash of each quorum's apk over time, which is used by the `BLSSignatureChecker` to fetch the "total signing key" for a quorum at a specific block number.
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Registering and Deregistering](#registering-and-deregistering)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  ---    
  
  ### Registering and Deregistering
  
  These methods are ONLY called through the `RegistryCoordinator` - when an Operator registers for or deregisters from one or more quorums:
  * [`registerBLSPublicKey`](#registerblspublickey)
  * [`registerOperator`](#registeroperator)
  * [`deregisterOperator`](#deregisteroperator)
  
  #### `registerBLSPublicKey`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerBLSPublicKey(
      address operator,
      PubkeyRegistrationParams calldata params,
      BN254.G1Point calldata pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash
  ) 
      external 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator 
      returns (bytes32 operatorId)
  
  struct PubkeyRegistrationParams {
      BN254.G1Point pubkeyRegistrationSignature;
      BN254.G1Point pubkeyG1;
      BN254.G2Point pubkeyG2;
  }
  ```
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`. It is called when an Operator registers for the AVS for the first time.
  
  This method validates a BLS signature over the `pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash`, then permanently assigns the pubkey to the Operator. The hash of `params.pubkeyG1` becomes the Operator's unique `operatorId`, which identifies the Operator throughout the registry contracts.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Registers the Operator's BLS pubkey for the first time, updating the following mappings:
      * `operatorToPubkey[operator]`
      * `operatorToPubkeyHash[operator]`
      * `pubkeyHashToOperator[pubkeyHash]`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `params.pubkeyG1` MUST NOT hash to the `ZERO_PK_HASH`
  * `operator` MUST NOT have already registered a pubkey:
      * `operatorToPubkeyHash[operator]` MUST be zero
      * `pubkeyHashToOperator[pubkeyHash]` MUST be zero
  * `params.pubkeyRegistrationSignature` MUST be a valid signature over `pubkeyRegistrationMessageHash`
  
  #### `registerOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperator(
      address operator,
      bytes memory quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  `registerOperator` fetches the Operator's registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above). Then, for each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, the Operator's pubkey is added to that quorum's `currentApk`. The `apkHistory` for the `quorumNumber` is also updated to reflect this change.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator registers for one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that `operator` is not already registered for any of `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * Add the Operator's pubkey to the quorum's apk in `currentApk[quorum]`
      * Updates the quorum's `apkHistory`, pushing a new `ApkUpdate` for the current block number and setting its `apkHash` to the new hash of `currentApk[quorum]`.
          * *Note:* If the most recent entry in `apkHistory[quorum]` was made during the current block, this method updates the most recent entry rather than pushing a new one.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `operator` MUST already have a registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above) 
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)
  
  #### `deregisterOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function deregisterOperator(
      address operator,
      bytes memory quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  `deregisterOperator` fetches the Operator's registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above). For each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, `deregisterOperator` performs the same steps as `registerOperator` above - except that the Operator's pubkey is negated. Whereas `registerOperator` "adds" a pubkey to each quorum's apk, `deregisterOperator` "subtracts" a pubkey from each quorum's apk.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator deregisters from one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that `operator` is registered for all quorums in `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.deregisterOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.ejectOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * Negate the Operator's pubkey, then subtract it from the quorum's apk in `currentApk[quorum]`
      * Updates the quorum's `apkHistory`, pushing a new `ApkUpdate` for the current block number and setting its `apkHash` to the new hash of `currentApk[quorum]`.
          * *Note:* If the most recent entry in `apkHistory[quorum]` was made during the current block, this method updates the most recent entry rather than pushing a new one.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `operator` MUST already have a registered BLS pubkey (see `registerBLSPublicKey` above)
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)
  
  ---
  
  ### System Configuration
  
  #### `initializeQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function initializeQuorum(
      uint8 quorumNumber
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`. It is called when the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner creates a new quorum.
  
  `initializeQuorum` initializes a new quorum by pushing an initial `ApkUpdate` to `apkHistory[quorumNumber]`. Other methods can validate that a quorum exists by checking whether `apkHistory[quorumNumber]` has a nonzero length.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.createQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Pushes an `ApkUpdate` to `apkHistory[quorumNumber]`. The update has a zeroed out `apkHash`, and its `updateBlockNumber` is set to the current block.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `apkHistory[quorumNumber].length` MUST be zero

  ## IndexRegistry
  
  | File | Type | Proxy? |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`IndexRegistry.sol`](../../src/IndexRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `IndexRegistry` provides an `operatorIndex` for every registered Operator in every quorum. For example, if a quorum has `n` Operators, every Operator registered for that quorum will have an `operatorIndex` in the range `[0:n-1]`. The role of this contract is to provide an AVS with a common, on-chain ordering of Operators within a quorum.
  
  *In EigenDA*, the Operator ordering properties of the `IndexRegistry` will eventually be used in proofs of custody, though this feature is not implemented yet.
  
  #### Important State Variables
  
  ```solidity
  /// @notice maps quorumNumber => operator id => current operatorIndex
  /// NOTE: This mapping is NOT updated when an operator is deregistered,
  /// so it's possible that an index retrieved from this mapping is inaccurate.
  /// If you're querying for an operator that might be deregistered, ALWAYS 
  /// check this index against the latest `_operatorIndexHistory` entry
  mapping(uint8 => mapping(bytes32 => uint32)) public currentOperatorIndex;
  
  /// @notice maps quorumNumber => operatorIndex => historical operator ids at that index
  mapping(uint8 => mapping(uint32 => OperatorUpdate[])) internal _operatorIndexHistory;
  
  /// @notice maps quorumNumber => historical number of unique registered operators
  mapping(uint8 => QuorumUpdate[]) internal _operatorCountHistory;
   
  struct OperatorUpdate {
      uint32 fromBlockNumber;
      bytes32 operatorId;
  }
  
  struct QuorumUpdate {
      uint32 fromBlockNumber;
      uint32 numOperators;
  }
  ```
  
  Operators are assigned a unique `operatorIndex` in each quorum they're registered for. If a quorum has `n` registered Operators, every Operator in that quorum will have an `operatorIndex` in the range `[0:n-1]`. To accomplish this, the `IndexRegistry` uses the three mappings listed above:
  * `currentOperatorIndex` is a straightforward mapping of an Operator's current `operatorIndex` in a specific quorum. It is updated when an Operator registers for a quorum.
  * `_operatorIndexHistory` keeps track of the `operatorIds` assigned to an `operatorIndex` at various points in time. This is used by offchain code to determine what `operatorId` belonged to an `operatorIndex` at a specific block.
  * `_operatorCountHistory` keeps track of the number of Operators registered to each quorum over time. Note that a quorum's Operator count is also its "max `operatorIndex` + 1". Paired with `_operatorIndexHistory`, this allows offchain code to query the entire Operator set registered for a quorum at a given block number. For an example of this in the code, see `IndexRegistry.getOperatorListAtBlockNumber`.
  
  *Note*: `currentOperatorIndex` is ONLY updated when an Operator is *assigned* to an `operatorIndex`. When an Operator deregisters and is removed, we don't update `currentOperatorIndex` because their `operatorIndex` is not "0" - that's held by another Operator. Their `operatorIndex` is also not the `operatorIndex` they currently have. There's not really a "right answer" for this - see https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/issues/126 for more details.

  * [Registering and Deregistering](#registering-and-deregistering)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)

  ### Registering and Deregistering
  
  These methods are ONLY called through the `RegistryCoordinator` - when an Operator registers for or deregisters from one or more quorums:
  * [`registerOperator`](#registeroperator)
  * [`deregisterOperator`](#deregisteroperator)
  
  #### `registerOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperator(
      bytes32 operatorId, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator 
      returns(uint32[] memory)
  ```
  
  When an Operator registers for a quorum, the following things happen:
  1. The current Operator count for the quorum is increased. 
      * This updates `_operatorCountHistory[quorum]`. The quorum's new "max `operatorIndex`" is equal to the quorum Operator count - 1.
      * Additionally, if the `_operatorIndexHistory` for the quorum indicates that this is the first time the quorum has reached a given Operator count, an initial `OperatorUpdate` is pushed to `_operatorIndexHistory` for the new operator count. This is to maintain an invariant: that existing quorum indices have nonzero history.
  2. The quorum's max index (Operator count - 1) is assigned to the registering Operator as their current `operatorIndex`.
      * This updates `currentOperatorIndex[quorum][operatorId]`
      * This also updates `_operatorIndexHistory[quorum][prevOperatorCount]`, recording the `operatorId` as the latest holder of the `operatorIndex` in question.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator registers for one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that the `operatorId` is not already registered for any of `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * Updates `_operatorCountHistory[quorum]`, increasing the quorum's `numOperators` by 1. 
          * Note that if the most recent update for the quorum is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * Updates `_operatorIndexHistory[quorum][newOperatorCount - 1]`, recording the `operatorId` as the latest holder of the new max `operatorIndex`. 
          * Note that if the most recent update for the quorum's index is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * Updates `currentOperatorIndex[quorum][operatorId]`, assigning the `operatorId` to the new max `operatorIndex`.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)
  
  #### `deregisterOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function deregisterOperator(
      bytes32 operatorId, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  When an Operator deregisters from a quorum, the following things happen:
  1. The current Operator count for the quorum is decreased, updating `_operatorCountHistory[quorum]`. The new "max `operatorIndex`" is equal to the new Operator count (minus 1).
  2. The Operator currently assigned to the now-invalid `operatorIndex` is "popped".
      * This updates `_operatorIndexHistory[quorum][newOperatorCount]`, recording that the Operator assigned to this `operatorIndex` is `OPERATOR_DOES_NOT_EXIST_ID`
  3. If the deregistering Operator and the popped Operator are not the same, the popped Operator is assigned a new `operatorIndex`: the deregistering Operator's previous `operatorIndex`.
      * This updates `_operatorIndexHistory[quorum][removedOperatorIndex]`, recording that the popped Operator is assigned to this `operatorIndex`.
      * This also updates `currentOperatorIndex[quorum][removedOperator]`, assigning the popped Operator to the old Operator's `operatorIndex`.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator deregisters from one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that the `operatorId` is currently registered for each quorum in `quorumNumbers`, and that there are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`. These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.deregisterOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.ejectOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * Updates `_operatorCountHistory[quorum]`, decreasing the quorum's `numOperators` by 1. 
          * Note that if the most recent update for the quorum is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * Updates `_operatorIndexHistory[quorum][newOperatorCount]`, "popping" the Operator that currently holds this `operatorIndex`, and marking it as assigned to `OPERATOR_DOES_NOT_EXIST_ID`. 
          * Note that if the most recent update for the quorum's `operatorIndex` is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * If `operatorId` is NOT the popped Operator, the popped Operator is assigned to `operatorId's` current `operatorIndex`. (Updates `_operatorIndexHistory` and `currentOperatorIndex`)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)

  ### System Configuration
  
  #### `initializeQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function initializeQuorum(
      uint8 quorumNumber
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`. It is called when the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner creates a new quorum.
  
  `initializeQuorum` initializes a new quorum by pushing an initial `QuorumUpdate` to `_operatorCountHistory[quorumNumber]`, setting the initial `numOperators` for the quorum to 0. 
  
  Other methods can validate that a quorum exists by checking whether `_operatorCountHistory[quorumNumber]` has a nonzero length.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.createQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Pushes a `QuorumUpdate` to `_operatorCountHistory[quorumNumber]`. The update's `updateBlockNumber` is set to the current block, and `numOperators` is set to 0.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `_operatorCountHistory[quorumNumber].length` MUST be zero

  ## StakeRegistry
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`StakeRegistry.sol`](../src/StakeRegistry.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `StakeRegistry` interfaces with the EigenLayer core contracts to determine the individual and collective stake weight of each Operator registered for each quorum. These weights are used to determine an Operator's relative weight for each of an AVS's quorums. And in the `RegistryCoordinator` specifically, they play an important role in *churn*: determining whether an Operator is eligible to replace another Operator in a quorum.
  
  #### Calculating Stake Weight
  
  Stake weight is primarily a function of the number of shares an Operator has been delegated within the EigenLayer core contracts, along with a per-quorum configuration maintained by the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner (see [System Configuration](#system-configuration) below). This configuration determines, for a given quorum, which Strategies "count" towards an Operator's total stake weight, as well as "how much" each Strategy counts for:
  
  ```solidity
  /// @notice maps quorumNumber => list of strategies considered (and each strategy's multiplier)
  mapping(uint8 => StrategyParams[]) public strategyParams;
  
  struct StrategyParams {
      IStrategy strategy;
      uint96 multiplier;
  }
  ```
  
  For a given quorum, an Operator's stake weight is determined by iterating over the quorum's list of `StrategyParams` and querying `DelegationManager.operatorShares(operator, strategy)`. The result is multiplied by the corresponding `multiplier` (and divided by the `WEIGHTING_DIVISOR`) to calculate the Operator's weight for that strategy. Then, this result is added to a growing sum of stake weights -- and after the quorum's `StrategyParams` have all been considered, the Operator's total stake weight is calculated.
  
  Note that the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner also configures a "minimum stake" for each quorum, which an Operator must meet in order to register for (or remain registered for) a quorum.
  
  For more information on the `DelegationManager`, strategies, and shares, see the [EigenLayer core docs][core-docs-dev].
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Registering and Deregistering](#registering-and-deregistering)
  * [Updating Registered Operators](#updating-registered-operators)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  ---    
  
  ### Registering and Deregistering
  
  These methods are ONLY called through the `RegistryCoordinator` - when an Operator registers for or deregisters from one or more quorums:
  * [`registerOperator`](#registeroperator)
  * [`deregisterOperator`](#deregisteroperator)
  
  #### `registerOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperator(
      address operator,
      bytes32 operatorId,
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator 
      returns (uint96[] memory, uint96[] memory)
  ```
  
  When an Operator registers for a quorum, the `StakeRegistry` first calculates the Operator's current weighted stake. If the Operator meets the quorum's configured minimum stake, the Operator's `operatorStakeHistory` is updated to reflect the Operator's current stake.
  
  Additionally, the Operator's stake is added to the `_totalStakeHistory` for that quorum.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator registers for one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that:
  * `operatorId` belongs to the `operator`
  * `operatorId` is not already registered for any of `quorumNumbers`
  * There are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`
  
  These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * The Operator's total stake weight is calculated, and the result is recorded in `operatorStakeHistory[operatorId][quorum]`.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * The Operator's total stake weight is added to the quorum's total stake weight in `_totalStakeHistory[quorum]`.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * The calculated total stake weight for the Operator MUST NOT be less than that quorum's minimum stake
  
  #### `deregisterOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function deregisterOperator(
      bytes32 operatorId,
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  ```
  
  When an Operator deregisters from a quorum, the `StakeRegistry` sets their stake to 0 and subtracts their stake from the quorum's total stake, updating `operatorStakeHistory` and `_totalStakeHistory`, respectively.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator deregisters from one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that:
  * `operatorId` is currently registered for each quorum in `quorumNumbers`
  * There are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`
  
  These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.registerOperatorWithChurn`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.deregisterOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.ejectOperator`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * The Operator's stake weight in `operatorStakeHistory[operatorId][quorum]` is set to 0.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * The Operator's stake weight is removed from the quorum's total stake weight in `_totalStakeHistory[quorum]`.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)

  ### Updating Registered Operators
  
  #### `updateOperatorStake`
  
  ```solidity
  function updateOperatorStake(
      address operator, 
      bytes32 operatorId, 
      bytes calldata quorumNumbers
  ) 
      external 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator 
      returns (uint192)
  ```
  
  AVSs will require up-to-date views on an Operator's stake. When an Operator's shares change in the EigenLayer core contracts (due to additional delegation, undelegation, withdrawals, etc), this change is not automatically pushed to middleware contracts. This is because middleware contracts are unique to each AVS, and core contract share updates would become prohibitively expensive if they needed to update each AVS every time an Operator's shares changed.
  
  Rather than *pushing* updates, `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators` and `updateOperatorsForQuorum` can be called by anyone to *pull* updates from the core contracts. Those `RegistryCoordinator` methods act as entry points for this method, which performs the same stake weight calculation as `registerOperator`, updating the Operator's `operatorStakeHistory` and the quorum's `_totalStakeHistory`.
  
  *Note*: there is one major difference between `updateOperatorStake` and `registerOperator` - if an Operator does NOT meet the minimum stake for a quorum, their stake weight is set to 0 and removed from the quorum's total stake weight, mimicing the behavior of `deregisterOperator`. For each quorum where this occurs, that quorum's number is added to a bitmap, `uint192 quorumsToRemove`, which is returned to the `RegistryCoordinator`. The `RegistryCoordinator` uses this returned bitmap to completely deregister Operators, maintaining an invariant that if an Operator's stake weight for a quorum is 0, they are NOT registered for that quorum.
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when an Operator registers for one or more quorums. This method *assumes* that:
  * `operatorId` belongs to the `operator`
  * `operatorId` is currently registered for each quorum in `quorumNumbers`
  * There are no duplicates in `quorumNumbers`
  
  These properties are enforced by the `RegistryCoordinator`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperators`
  * `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each `quorum` in `quorumNumbers`:
      * The Operator's total stake weight is calculated, and the result is recorded in `operatorStakeHistory[operatorId][quorum]`. If the Operator does NOT meet the quorum's configured minimum stake, their stake weight is set to 0 instead.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
      * The Operator's stake weight delta is applied to the quorum's total stake weight in `_totalStakeHistory[quorum]`.
          * Note that if the most recent update is from the current block number, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is pushed.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * Each quorum in `quorumNumbers` MUST be initialized (see `initializeQuorum` below)
  
  ---
  
  ### System Configuration
  
  This method is used by the `RegistryCoordinator` to initialize new quorums in the `StakeRegistry`:
  * [`initializeQuorum`](#initializequorum)
  
  These methods are used by the `RegistryCoordinator's` Owner to configure initialized quorums in the `StakeRegistry`. They are not expected to be called very often, and will require updating Operator stakes via `RegistryCoordinator.updateOperatorsForQuorum` to maintain up-to-date views on Operator stake weights. Methods follow:
  * [`setMinimumStakeForQuorum`](#setminimumstakeforquorum)
  * [`addStrategies`](#addstrategies)
  * [`removeStrategies`](#removestrategies)
  * [`modifyStrategyParams`](#modifystrategyparams)
  
  #### `initializeQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function initializeQuorum(
      uint8 quorumNumber,
      uint96 minimumStake,
      StrategyParams[] memory _strategyParams
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyRegistryCoordinator
  
  struct StrategyParams {
      IStrategy strategy;
      uint96 multiplier;
  }
  ```
  
  This method is ONLY callable by the `RegistryCoordinator`, and is called when the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner creates a new quorum.
  
  `initializeQuorum` initializes a new quorum by pushing an initial `StakeUpdate` to `_totalStakeHistory[quorumNumber]`, with an initial stake of 0. Other methods can validate that a quorum exists by checking whether `_totalStakeHistory[quorumNumber]` has a nonzero length.
  
  Additionally, this method configures a `minimumStake` for the quorum, as well as the `StrategyParams` it considers when calculating stake weight.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `RegistryCoordinator.createQuorum`
  
  *Effects*:
  * See `addStrategies` below
  * See `setMinimumStakeForQuorum` below
  * Pushes a `StakeUpdate` to `_totalStakeHistory[quorumNumber]`. The update's `updateBlockNumber` is set to the current block, and `stake` is set to 0.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `RegistryCoordinator`
  * `quorumNumber` MUST NOT belong to an existing, initialized quorum
  * See `addStrategies` below
  * See `setMinimumStakeForQuorum` below
  
  #### `setMinimumStakeForQuorum`
  
  ```solidity
  function setMinimumStakeForQuorum(
      uint8 quorumNumber, 
      uint96 minimumStake
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyCoordinatorOwner 
      quorumExists(quorumNumber)
  ```
  
  Allows the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner to configure the `minimumStake` for an existing quorum. This value is used to determine whether an Operator has sufficient stake to register for (or stay registered for) a quorum.
  
  There is no lower or upper bound on a quorum's minimum stake.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Set `minimumStakeForQuorum[quorum]` to `minimumStake`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be `RegistryCoordinator.owner()`
  * `quorumNumber` MUST belong to an existing, initialized quorum
  
  #### `addStrategies`
  
  ```solidity
  function addStrategies(
      uint8 quorumNumber, 
      StrategyParams[] memory _strategyParams
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyCoordinatorOwner 
      quorumExists(quorumNumber)
  
  struct StrategyParams {
      IStrategy strategy;
      uint96 multiplier;
  }
  ```
  
  Allows the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner to add `StrategyParams` to a quorum, which effect how Operators' stake weights are calculated.
  
  For each `StrategyParams` added, this method checks that the incoming `strategy` has not already been added to the quorum. This is done via a relatively expensive loop over storage, but this function isn't expected to be called very often.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Each added `_strategyParams` is pushed to the quorum's stored `strategyParams[quorumNumber]`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be `RegistryCoordinator.owner()`
  * `quorumNumber` MUST belong to an existing, initialized quorum
  * `_strategyParams` MUST NOT be empty
  * The quorum's current `StrategyParams` count plus the new `_strategyParams` MUST NOT exceed `MAX_WEIGHING_FUNCTION_LENGTH`
  * `_strategyParams` MUST NOT contain duplicates, and MUST NOT contain strategies that are already being considered by the quorum
  * For each `_strategyParams` being added, the `multiplier` MUST NOT be 0
  
  #### `removeStrategies`
  
  ```solidity
  function removeStrategies(
      uint8 quorumNumber,
      uint256[] memory indicesToRemove
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyCoordinatorOwner 
      quorumExists(quorumNumber)
  
  struct StrategyParams {
      IStrategy strategy;
      uint96 multiplier;
  }
  ```
  
  Allows the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner to remove `StrategyParams` from a quorum, which effect how Operators' stake weights are calculated. Removals are processed by removing specific indices passed in by the caller.
  
  For each `StrategyParams` removed, this method replaces `strategyParams[quorumNumber][indicesToRemove[i]]` with the last item in `strategyParams[quorumNumber]`, then pops the last element of `strategyParams[quorumNumber]`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Removes the specified `StrategyParams` according to their index in the quorum's `strategyParams` list.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be `RegistryCoordinator.owner()`
  * `quorumNumber` MUST belong to an existing, initialized quorum
  * `indicesToRemove` MUST NOT be empty
  
  #### `modifyStrategyParams`
  
  ```solidity
  function modifyStrategyParams(
      uint8 quorumNumber,
      uint256[] calldata strategyIndices,
      uint96[] calldata newMultipliers
  ) 
      public 
      virtual 
      onlyCoordinatorOwner 
      quorumExists(quorumNumber)
  
  struct StrategyParams {
      IStrategy strategy;
      uint96 multiplier;
  }
  ```
  
  Allows the `RegistryCoordinator` Owner to modify the multipliers specified in a quorum's configured `StrategyParams`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * The quorum's `StrategyParams` at the specified `strategyIndices` are given a new multiplier
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be `RegistryCoordinator.owner()`
  * `quorumNumber` MUST belong to an existing, initialized quorum
  * `strategyIndices` MUST NOT be empty
  * `strategyIndices` and `newMultipliers` MUST have equal lengths

  User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows: 'As a PERSONA, I want to GOAL_DESCRIPTION, so that CUSTOMER_VALUE_DESCRIPTION.' Alternatively for 
  
  **Actions**
  - [ ] An action item list describing the work to be done
  - [ ] Link to all of the related tasks needed to complete the feature. See the [tasks](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.md) template.
  - [ ] Include everything in the definition of done e.g. unit tests and documentation
  
  **Acceptance criteria**
  Acceptance criteria are the requirements that need to be met in order to mark a user story as complete. For example, if your user story is, "As a New Relic customer, I want to know how to interpret AI anomalies in order to monitor my site and protect myself against incidents," then the acceptance criteria would be: "A complete and published doc describing AI anomalies," and all related quality checks.

  # EigenLayer
  
  EigenLayer is a set of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum that enable restaking of assets to secure new services. This repo contains the EigenLayer core contracts, whose currently-supported assets include beacon chain ETH and several liquid staking tokens (LSTs). Users use these contracts to deposit and withdraw these assets, as well as delegate them to operators providing services to AVSs.
  
  ## Getting Started
  
  * [Branching](#branching)
  * [Documentation](#documentation)
  * [Building and Running Tests](#building-and-running-tests)
  * [Deployments](#deployments)
  
  ## Branching
  
  The main branches we use are:
  * [`dev (default)`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/dev): The most up-to-date branch, containing the work-in-progress code for upcoming releases
  * [`testnet-holesky`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/testnet-holesky): Our current testnet deployment
  * [`mainnet`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/mainnet): Our current mainnet deloyment
  
  ## Documentation
  
  ### Basics
  
  To get a basic understanding of EigenLayer, check out [You Could've Invented EigenLayer](https://www.blog.eigenlayer.xyz/ycie/). Note that some of the document's content describes features that do not exist yet (like the Slasher). To understand more about how restakers and operators interact with EigenLayer, check out these guides:
  * [Restaking User Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide)
  * [Operator Guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/operator-guides/operator-introduction)
  
  ### Deep Dive
  
  The most up-to-date and technical documentation can be found in [/docs](/docs). If you're a shadowy super coder, this is a great place to get an overview of the contracts before diving into the code.
  
  To get an idea of how users interact with these contracts, check out our integration tests: [/src/test/integration](./src/test/integration/).
  
  ## Building and Running Tests
  
  This repository uses Foundry. See the [Foundry docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for more info on installation and usage. If you already have foundry, you can build this project and run tests with these commands:
  
  ```
  foundryup
  
  forge build
  forge test
  ```
  
  ### Running Fork Tests
  
  We have a few fork tests against ETH mainnet. Passing these requires the environment variable `RPC_MAINNET` to be set. See `.env.example` for an example. Once you've set up your environment, `forge test` should show these fork tests passing.
  
  Additionally, to run all tests in a forked environment, [install yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/v/v3.x/). Then, set up your environment using this script to read from `config.yml`:
  
  `source source-env.sh [goerli|local]`
  
  Then run the tests:
  
  `forge test --fork-url [RPC_URL]`
  
  ### Running Static Analysis
  
  1. Install [solhint](https://github.com/protofire/solhint), then run:
  
  `solhint 'src/contracts/**/*.sol'`
  
  2. Install [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), then run:
  
  `slither .`
  
  ### Generate Inheritance and Control-Flow Graphs
  
  1. Install [surya](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya/) and graphviz:
  
  ```
  npm i -g surya
  
  apt install graphviz
  ```
  
  2. Then, run:
  
  ```
  surya inheritance ./src/contracts/**/*.sol | dot -Tpng > InheritanceGraph.png
  
  surya mdreport surya_report.md ./src/contracts/**/*.sol
  ```
  
  ## Deployments
  
  ### Current Mainnet Deployment
  
  The current mainnet deployment is our M2 release. You can view the deployed contract addresses below, or check out the code itself on the [`mainnet`](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/tree/mainnet) branch.

  ## EigenLayer M2 Docs
  
  This repo contains the EigenLayer core contracts, which enable restaking of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and beacon chain ETH to secure new services, called AVSs (actively validated services). For more info on AVSs, check out the EigenLayer middleware contracts [here][middleware-repo].
  
  This document provides an overview of system components, contracts, and user roles. Further documentation on the major system contracts can be found in [/core](./core/).

  ### System Components
  
  #### EigenPodManager
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`EigenPodManager.sol`](../src/contracts/pods/EigenPodManager.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`EigenPod.sol`](../src/contracts/pods/EigenPod.sol) | Instanced, deployed per-user | Beacon proxy |
  | [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.sol`](../src/contracts/pods/DelayedWithdrawalRouter.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`succinctlabs/EigenLayerBeaconOracle.sol`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/telepathy-contracts/blob/main/external/integrations/eigenlayer/EigenLayerBeaconOracle.sol) | Singleton | UUPS proxy | [`0x40B1...9f2c`](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x40B10ddD29a2cfF33DBC420AE5bbDa0649049f2c) |
  
  These contracts work together to enable native ETH restaking:
  * Users deploy `EigenPods` via the `EigenPodManager`, which contain beacon chain state proof logic used to verify a validator's withdrawal credentials, balance, and exit. An `EigenPod's` main role is to serve as the withdrawal address for one or more of a user's validators.
  * The `EigenPodManager` handles `EigenPod` creation and accounting+interactions between users with restaked native ETH and the `DelegationManager`.
  * The `DelayedWithdrawalRouter` imposes a 7-day delay on completing partial beacon chain withdrawals from an `EigenPod`. This is primarily to add a stopgap against a hack being able to instantly withdraw funds (note that all withdrawals from EigenLayer -- other than partial withdrawals earned by validators -- are initiated via the `DelegationManager`).
  * The `EigenLayerBeaconOracle` provides beacon chain block roots for use in various proofs. The oracle is supplied by Succinct's Telepathy protocol ([docs link](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/)).
  
  See full documentation in [`/core/EigenPodManager.md`](./core/EigenPodManager.md).
  
  #### StrategyManager
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`StrategyManager.sol`](../src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.sol`](../src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBaseTVLLimits.sol) | One instance per supported LST | Transparent proxy |
  
  These contracts work together to enable restaking for LSTs:
  * The `StrategyManager` acts as the entry and exit point for LSTs in EigenLayer. It handles deposits into LST-specific strategies, and manages accounting+interactions between users with restaked LSTs and the `DelegationManager`.
  * `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` is deployed as multiple separate instances, one for each supported LST. When a user deposits into a strategy through the `StrategyManager`, this contract receives the tokens and awards the user with a proportional quantity of shares in the strategy. When a user withdraws, the strategy contract sends the LSTs back to the user.
  
  See full documentation in [`/core/StrategyManager.md`](./core/StrategyManager.md).
  
  #### DelegationManager
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`DelegationManager.sol`](../src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `DelegationManager` sits between the `EigenPodManager` and `StrategyManager` to manage delegation and undelegation of Stakers to Operators. Its primary features are to allow Operators to register as Operators (`registerAsOperator`), to keep track of shares being delegated to Operators across different strategies, and to manage withdrawals on behalf of the `EigenPodManager` and `StrategyManager`.
  
  See full documentation in [`/core/DelegationManager.md`](./core/DelegationManager.md).
  
  #### AVSDirectory
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`AVSDirectory.sol`](../src/contracts/core/AVSDirectory.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `AVSDirectory` handles interactions between AVSs and the EigenLayer core contracts. Once registered as an Operator in EigenLayer core (via the `DelegationManager`), Operators can register with one or more AVSs (via the AVS's contracts) to begin providing services to them offchain. As a part of registering with an AVS, the AVS will record this registration in the core contracts by calling into the `AVSDirectory`.
  
  See full documentation in [`/core/AVSDirectory.md`](./core/AVSDirectory.md).
  
  For more information on AVS contracts, see the [middleware repo][middleware-repo].
  
  #### Slasher
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`Slasher.sol`](../src/contracts/core/Slasher.sol) | - | - |
  
  <p align="center"><b>
  🚧 The Slasher contract is under active development and its interface expected to change. We recommend writing slashing logic without integrating with the Slasher at this point in time. Although the Slasher is deployed, it will remain completely paused/unusable during M2. No contracts interact with it, and its design is not finalized. 🚧
  </b><p>
  
  ---
  
  #### Roles and Actors
  
  To see an example of the user flows described in this section, check out our integration tests: [/src/test/integration](../src/test/integration/).
  
  ##### Staker
  
  A Staker is any party who has assets deposited (or "restaked") into EigenLayer. Currently, these assets can be:
  * Native beacon chain ETH (via the EigenPodManager)
  * Liquid staking tokens (via the StrategyManager): cbETH, rETH, stETH, ankrETH, OETH, osETH, swETH, wBETH
  
  Stakers can restake any combination of these: a Staker may hold ALL of these assets, or only one of them.
  
  *Flows:*
  * Stakers **deposit** assets into EigenLayer via either the StrategyManager (for LSTs) or EigenPodManager (for beacon chain ETH)
  * Stakers **withdraw** assets via the DelegationManager, *no matter what assets they're withdrawing*
  * Stakers **delegate** to an Operator via the DelegationManager
  
  Unimplemented as of M2:
  * Stakers earn yield by delegating to an Operator as the Operator provides services to an AVS
  * Stakers are at risk of being slashed if the Operator misbehaves
  
  ##### Operator
  
  An Operator is a user who helps run the software built on top of EigenLayer (AVSs). Operators register in EigenLayer and allow Stakers to delegate to them, then opt in to provide various services built on top of EigenLayer. Operators may themselves be Stakers; these are not mutually exclusive.
  
  *Flows:*
  * User can **register** as an Operator via the DelegationManager
  * Operators can **deposit** and **withdraw** assets just like Stakers can
  * Operators can opt in to providing services for an AVS using that AVS's middleware contracts. See the [EigenLayer middleware][middleware-repo] repo for more details.
  
  *Unimplemented as of M2:*
  * Operators earn fees as part of the services they provide
  * Operators may be slashed by the services they register with (if they misbehave)

  #### Common User Flows
  
  ##### Depositing Into EigenLayer
  
  Depositing into EigenLayer varies depending on whether the Staker is depositing Native ETH or LSTs:
  
  ![.](./images/Staker%20Flow%20Diagrams/Depositing.png)
  
  ##### Delegating to an Operator
  
  ![.](./images/Staker%20Flow%20Diagrams/Delegating.png)
  
  ##### Undelegating or Queueing a Withdrawal
  
  Undelegating from an Operator automatically queues a withdrawal that needs to go through the `DelegationManager's` withdrawal delay. Stakers that want to withdraw can choose to `undelegate`, or can simply call `queueWithdrawals` directly.

  ##### Completing a Withdrawal as Shares
  
  This flow is mostly useful if a Staker wants to change which Operator they are delegated to. The Staker first needs to undelegate (see above). At this point, they can delegate to a different Operator. However, the new Operator will only be awarded shares once the Staker completes their queued withdrawal "as shares":
  
  ![.](./images/Staker%20Flow%20Diagrams/Complete%20Withdrawal%20as%20Shares.png)
  
  ##### Completing a Withdrawal as Tokens
  
  Completing a queued withdrawal as tokens is roughly the same for both native ETH and LSTs. 
  
  However, note that *before* a withdrawal can be completed, native ETH stakers will need to perform additional steps, detailed in the "Withdrawal Processing" diagrams below. 
  
  ![.](./images/Staker%20Flow%20Diagrams/Complete%20Withdrawal%20as%20Tokens.png)
  
  ##### Withdrawal Processing: Validator Exits
  
  If a Staker wants to fully withdraw from the beacon chain, they need to perform these additional steps before their withdrawal is completable:
  
  ![.](./images/Staker%20Flow%20Diagrams/Validator%20Exits.png)
  
  ##### Withdrawal Processing: Partial Beacon Chain Withdrawals
  
  If a Staker wants to withdraw consensus rewards from the beacon chain, they do NOT go through the `DelegationManager`. This is the only withdrawal type that is not initiated in the `DelegationManager`:

  ## AVSDirectory
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`AVSDirectory.sol`](../../src/contracts/core/AVSDirectory.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The `AVSDirectory` handles interactions between AVSs and the EigenLayer core contracts. Once registered as an Operator in EigenLayer core (via the `DelegationManager`), Operators can register with one or more AVSs (via the AVS's contracts) to begin providing services to them offchain. As a part of registering with an AVS, the AVS will record this registration in the core contracts by calling into the `AVSDirectory`.
  
  For more information on AVS contracts, see the [middleware repo][middleware-repo].
  
  Currently, the only interactions between AVSs and the core contracts is to track whether Operators are currently registered for the AVS. This is handled by two methods:
  * [`AVSDirectory.registerOperatorToAVS`](#registeroperatortoavs)
  * [`AVSDirectory.deregisterOperatorFromAVS`](#deregisteroperatorfromavs)
  
  In a future release, this contract will implement additional interactions that relate to (i) paying Operators for the services they provide and (ii) slashing Operators that misbehave. Currently, these features are not implemented.

  #### `registerOperatorToAVS`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerOperatorToAVS(
      address operator,
      ISignatureUtils.SignatureWithSaltAndExpiry memory operatorSignature
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_OPERATOR_REGISTER_DEREGISTER_TO_AVS)
  ```
  
  Allows the caller (an AVS) to register an `operator` with itself, given the provided signature is valid.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets the `operator's` status to `REGISTERED` for the AVS
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_OPERATOR_REGISTER_DEREGISTER_TO_AVS`
  * `operator` MUST already be a registered Operator (via the `DelegationManager`)
  * `operator` MUST NOT already be registered with the AVS
  * `operatorSignature` must be a valid, unused, unexpired signature from the `operator`. The signature is an ECDSA signature by the operator over the [`OPERATOR_AVS_REGISTRATION_TYPEHASH`](../../src/contracts/core/DelegationManagerStorage.sol). Expiry is a utc timestamp in seconds. Salt is used only once per signature to prevent replay attacks.
  
  *As of M2*:
  * Operator registration/deregistration does not have any sort of consequences for the Operator or its shares. Eventually, this will tie into payments for services and slashing for misbehavior.
  
  #### `deregisterOperatorFromAVS`
  
  ```solidity
  function deregisterOperatorFromAVS(
      address operator
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_OPERATOR_REGISTER_DEREGISTER_TO_AVS)
  ```
  
  Allows the caller (an AVS) to deregister an `operator` with itself
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets the `operator's` status to `UNREGISTERED` for the AVS
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_OPERATOR_REGISTER_DEREGISTER_TO_AVS`
  * `operator` MUST already be registered with the AVS
  
  *As of M2*:
  * Operator registration/deregistration does not have any sort of consequences for the Operator or its shares. Eventually, this will tie into payments for services and slashing for misbehavior.
  
  #### `cancelSalt`
  
  ```solidity
  function cancelSalt(bytes32 salt) external
  ```
  
  Allows the caller (an Operator) to cancel a signature salt before it is used to register for an AVS.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets `operatorSaltIsSpent[msg.sender][salt]` to `true`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Salt MUST NOT already be cancelled

  ## DelegationManager
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`DelegationManager.sol`](../../src/contracts/core/DelegationManager.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  
  The primary functions of the `DelegationManager` are (i) to allow Stakers to delegate to Operators, (ii) allow Stakers to be undelegated from Operators, and (iii) handle withdrawals and withdrawal processing for shares in both the `StrategyManager` and `EigenPodManager`.
  
  Whereas the `EigenPodManager` and `StrategyManager` perform accounting for individual Stakers according to their native ETH or LST holdings respectively, the `DelegationManager` sits between these two contracts and tracks these accounting changes according to the Operators each Staker has delegated to. 
  
  This means that each time a Staker's balance changes in either the `EigenPodManager` or `StrategyManager`, the `DelegationManager` is called to record this update to the Staker's delegated Operator (if they have one). For example, if a Staker is delegated to an Operator and deposits into a strategy, the `StrategyManager` will call the `DelegationManager` to update the Operator's delegated shares for that strategy.
  
  Additionally, whether a Staker is delegated to an Operator or not, the `DelegationManager` is how a Staker queues (and later completes) a withdrawal.
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Becoming an Operator](#becoming-an-operator)
  * [Delegating to an Operator](#delegating-to-an-operator)
  * [Undelegating and Withdrawing](#undelegating-and-withdrawing)
  * [Accounting](#accounting)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  #### Important state variables
  
  * `mapping(address => address) public delegatedTo`: Staker => Operator.
      * If a Staker is not delegated to anyone, `delegatedTo` is unset.
      * Operators are delegated to themselves - `delegatedTo[operator] == operator`
  * `mapping(address => mapping(IStrategy => uint256)) public operatorShares`: Tracks the current balance of shares an Operator is delegated according to each strategy. Updated by both the `StrategyManager` and `EigenPodManager` when a Staker's delegatable balance changes.
      * Because Operators are delegated to themselves, an Operator's own restaked assets are reflected in these balances.
      * A similar mapping exists in the `StrategyManager`, but the `DelegationManager` additionally tracks beacon chain ETH delegated via the `EigenPodManager`. The "beacon chain ETH" strategy gets its own special address for this mapping: `0xbeaC0eeEeeeeEEeEeEEEEeeEEeEeeeEeeEEBEaC0`.
  * `uint256 public minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`:
      * As of M2, this is 50400 (roughly 1 week)
      * For all strategies including native beacon chain ETH, Stakers at minimum must wait this amount of time before a withdrawal can be completed.
      To withdraw a specific strategy, it may require additional time depending on the strategy's withdrawal delay. See `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks` below.
  * `mapping(IStrategy => uint256) public strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks`:
      * This mapping tracks the withdrawal delay for each strategy. This mapping value only comes into affect
      if `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks[strategy] > minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`. Otherwise, `minWithdrawalDelayBlocks` is used.
  * `mapping(bytes32 => bool) public pendingWithdrawals;`:
      * `Withdrawals` are hashed and set to `true` in this mapping when a withdrawal is initiated. The hash is set to false again when the withdrawal is completed. A per-staker nonce provides a way to distinguish multiple otherwise-identical withdrawals.
  
  #### Helpful definitions
  
  * `isDelegated(address staker) -> (bool)`
      * True if `delegatedTo[staker] != address(0)`
  * `isOperator(address operator) -> (bool)` 
      * True if `_operatorDetails[operator].earningsReceiver != address(0)`

  ### Becoming an Operator
  
  Operators interact with the following functions to become an Operator:
  
  * [`DelegationManager.registerAsOperator`](#registerasoperator)
  * [`DelegationManager.modifyOperatorDetails`](#modifyoperatordetails)
  * [`DelegationManager.updateOperatorMetadataURI`](#updateoperatormetadatauri)
  
  #### `registerAsOperator`
  
  ```solidity
  function registerAsOperator(OperatorDetails calldata registeringOperatorDetails, string calldata metadataURI) external
  ```
  
  Registers the caller as an Operator in EigenLayer. The new Operator provides the `OperatorDetails`, a struct containing:
  * `address earningsReceiver`: the address that will receive earnings as the Operator provides services to AVSs *(currently unused)*
  * `address delegationApprover`: if set, this address must sign and approve new delegation from Stakers to this Operator *(optional)*
  * `uint32 stakerOptOutWindowBlocks`: the minimum delay (in blocks) between beginning and completing registration for an AVS. *(currently unused)*
  
  `registerAsOperator` cements the Operator's `OperatorDetails`, and self-delegates the Operator to themselves - permanently marking the caller as an Operator. They cannot "deregister" as an Operator - however, they can exit the system by withdrawing their funds via `queueWithdrawals`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets `OperatorDetails` for the Operator in question
  * Delegates the Operator to itself
  * If the Operator has shares in the `EigenPodManager`, the `DelegationManager` adds these shares to the Operator's shares for the beacon chain ETH strategy.
  * For each of the strategies in the `StrategyManager`, if the Operator holds shares in that strategy they are added to the Operator's shares under the corresponding strategy.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST NOT already be an Operator
  * Caller MUST NOT already be delegated to an Operator
  * `earningsReceiver != address(0)`
  * `stakerOptOutWindowBlocks <= MAX_STAKER_OPT_OUT_WINDOW_BLOCKS`: (~180 days)
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NEW_DELEGATION`
  
  #### `modifyOperatorDetails`
  
  ```solidity
  function modifyOperatorDetails(OperatorDetails calldata newOperatorDetails) external
  ```
  
  Allows an Operator to update their stored `OperatorDetails`.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST already be an Operator
  * `new earningsReceiver != address(0)`
  * `new stakerOptOutWindowBlocks >= old stakerOptOutWindowBlocks`
  * `new stakerOptOutWindowBlocks <= MAX_STAKER_OPT_OUT_WINDOW_BLOCKS`
  
  #### `updateOperatorMetadataURI`
  
  ```solidity
  function updateOperatorMetadataURI(string calldata metadataURI) external
  ```
  
  Allows an Operator to emit an `OperatorMetadataURIUpdated` event. No other state changes occur.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST already be an Operator
  
  ---
  
  ### Delegating to an Operator
  
  Stakers interact with the following functions to delegate their shares to an Operator:
  
  * [`DelegationManager.delegateTo`](#delegateto)
  * [`DelegationManager.delegateToBySignature`](#delegatetobysignature)
  
  #### `delegateTo`
  
  ```solidity
  function delegateTo(
      address operator, 
      SignatureWithExpiry memory approverSignatureAndExpiry, 
      bytes32 approverSalt
  ) 
      external
  ```
  
  Allows the caller (a Staker) to delegate their shares to an Operator. Delegation is all-or-nothing: when a Staker delegates to an Operator, they delegate ALL their shares. For each strategy the Staker has shares in, the `DelegationManager` will update the Operator's corresponding delegated share amounts.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Records the Staker as being delegated to the Operator
  * If the Staker has shares in the `EigenPodManager`, the `DelegationManager` adds these shares to the Operator's shares for the beacon chain ETH strategy.
  * For each of the strategies in the `StrategyManager`, if the Staker holds shares in that strategy they are added to the Operator's shares under the corresponding strategy.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NEW_DELEGATION`
  * The caller MUST NOT already be delegated to an Operator
  * The `operator` MUST already be an Operator
  * If the `operator` has a `delegationApprover`, the caller MUST provide a valid `approverSignatureAndExpiry` and `approverSalt`
  
  #### `delegateToBySignature`
  
  ```solidity
  function delegateToBySignature(
      address staker,
      address operator,
      SignatureWithExpiry memory stakerSignatureAndExpiry,
      SignatureWithExpiry memory approverSignatureAndExpiry,
      bytes32 approverSalt
  ) 
      external
  ```
  
  Allows a Staker to delegate to an Operator by way of signature. This function can be called by three different parties:
  * If the Operator calls this method, they need to submit only the `stakerSignatureAndExpiry`
  * If the Operator's `delegationApprover` calls this method, they need to submit only the `stakerSignatureAndExpiry`
  * If the anyone else calls this method, they need to submit both the `stakerSignatureAndExpiry` AND `approverSignatureAndExpiry`
  
  *Effects*: See `delegateTo` above.
  
  *Requirements*: See `delegateTo` above. Additionally:
  * If caller is either the Operator's `delegationApprover` or the Operator, the `approverSignatureAndExpiry` and `approverSalt` can be empty
  * `stakerSignatureAndExpiry` MUST be a valid, unexpired signature over the correct hash and nonce
  
  ---
  
  ### Undelegating and Withdrawing
  
  These methods can be called by both Stakers AND Operators, and are used to (i) undelegate a Staker from an Operator, (ii) queue a withdrawal of a Staker/Operator's shares, or (iii) complete a queued withdrawal:
  
  * [`DelegationManager.undelegate`](#undelegate)
  * [`DelegationManager.queueWithdrawals`](#queuewithdrawals)
  * [`DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`](#completequeuedwithdrawal)
  * [`DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`](#completequeuedwithdrawals)
  
  #### `undelegate`
  
  ```solidity
  function undelegate(
      address staker
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_ENTER_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE)
      returns (bytes32[] memory withdrawalRoots)
  ```
  
  `undelegate` can be called by a Staker to undelegate themselves, or by a Staker's delegated Operator (or that Operator's `delegationApprover`). Undelegation (i) queues withdrawals on behalf of the Staker for all their delegated shares, and (ii) decreases the Operator's delegated shares according to the amounts and strategies being withdrawn.
  
  If the Staker has active shares in either the `EigenPodManager` or `StrategyManager`, they are removed while the withdrawal is in the queue - and an individual withdrawal is queued for each strategy removed.
  
  The withdrawals can be completed by the Staker after max(`minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`, `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks[strategy]`) where `strategy` is any of the Staker's delegated strategies. This does not require the Staker to "fully exit" from the system -- the Staker may choose to receive their shares back in full once withdrawals are completed (see [`completeQueuedWithdrawal`](#completequeuedwithdrawal) for details).
  
  Note that becoming an Operator is irreversible! Although Operators can withdraw, they cannot use this method to undelegate from themselves.
  
  *Effects*: 
  * Any shares held by the Staker in the `EigenPodManager` and `StrategyManager` are removed from the Operator's delegated shares.
  * The Staker is undelegated from the Operator
  * If the Staker has no delegatable shares, there is no withdrawal queued or further effects
  * For each strategy being withdrawn, a `Withdrawal` is queued for the Staker:
      * The Staker's withdrawal nonce is increased by 1 for each `Withdrawal`
      * The hash of each `Withdrawal` is marked as "pending"
  * See [`EigenPodManager.removeShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerremoveshares)
  * See [`StrategyManager.removeShares`](./StrategyManager.md#removeshares)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_ENTER_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE`
  * Staker MUST exist and be delegated to someone
  * Staker MUST NOT be an Operator
  * `staker` parameter MUST NOT be zero
  * Caller must be either the Staker, their Operator, or their Operator's `delegationApprover`
  * See [`EigenPodManager.removeShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerremoveshares)
  * See [`StrategyManager.removeShares`](./StrategyManager.md#removeshares)
  
  #### `queueWithdrawals`
  
  ```solidity
  function queueWithdrawals(
      QueuedWithdrawalParams[] calldata queuedWithdrawalParams
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_ENTER_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE) 
      returns (bytes32[] memory)
  ```
  
  Allows the caller to queue one or more withdrawals of their held shares across any strategy (in either/both the `EigenPodManager` or `StrategyManager`). If the caller is delegated to an Operator, the `shares` and `strategies` being withdrawn are immediately removed from that Operator's delegated share balances. Note that if the caller is an Operator, this still applies, as Operators are essentially delegated to themselves.
  
  `queueWithdrawals` works very similarly to `undelegate`, except that the caller is not undelegated, and also may choose which strategies and how many shares to withdraw (as opposed to ALL shares/strategies).
  
  All shares being withdrawn (whether via the `EigenPodManager` or `StrategyManager`) are removed while the withdrawals are in the queue.
  
  Withdrawals can be completed by the caller after max(`minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`, `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks[strategy]`) such that `strategy` represents the queued strategies to be withdrawn. Withdrawals do not require the caller to "fully exit" from the system -- they may choose to receive their shares back in full once the withdrawal is completed (see [`completeQueuedWithdrawal`](#completequeuedwithdrawal) for details). 
  
  Note that the `QueuedWithdrawalParams` struct has a `withdrawer` field. Originally, this was used to specify an address that the withdrawal would be credited to once completed. However, `queueWithdrawals` now requires that `withdrawer == msg.sender`. Any other input is rejected.
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each withdrawal:
      * If the caller is delegated to an Operator, that Operator's delegated balances are decreased according to the `strategies` and `shares` being withdrawn.
      * A `Withdrawal` is queued for the caller, tracking the strategies and shares being withdrawn
          * The caller's withdrawal nonce is increased
          * The hash of the `Withdrawal` is marked as "pending"
      * See [`EigenPodManager.removeShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerremoveshares)
      * See [`StrategyManager.removeShares`](./StrategyManager.md#removeshares)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_ENTER_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE`
  * For each withdrawal:
      * `strategies.length` MUST equal `shares.length`
      * `strategies.length` MUST NOT be equal to 0
      * The `withdrawer` MUST equal `msg.sender`
      * See [`EigenPodManager.removeShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerremoveshares)
      * See [`StrategyManager.removeShares`](./StrategyManager.md#removeshares)
  
  #### `completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  
  ```solidity
  function completeQueuedWithdrawal(
      Withdrawal calldata withdrawal,
      IERC20[] calldata tokens,
      uint256 middlewareTimesIndex,
      bool receiveAsTokens
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EXIT_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE)
      nonReentrant
  ```
  
  After waiting max(`minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`, `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks[strategy]`) number of blocks, this allows the `withdrawer` of a `Withdrawal` to finalize a withdrawal and receive either (i) the underlying tokens of the strategies being withdrawn from, or (ii) the shares being withdrawn. This choice is dependent on the passed-in parameter `receiveAsTokens`.
  
  For each strategy/share pair in the `Withdrawal`:
  * If the `withdrawer` chooses to receive tokens:
      * The shares are converted to their underlying tokens via either the `EigenPodManager` or `StrategyManager` and sent to the `withdrawer`.
  * If the `withdrawer` chooses to receive shares (and the strategy belongs to the `StrategyManager`): 
      * The shares are awarded to the `withdrawer` via the `StrategyManager`
      * If the `withdrawer` is delegated to an Operator, that Operator's delegated shares are increased by the added shares (according to the strategy being added to).
  
  `Withdrawals` concerning `EigenPodManager` shares have some additional nuance depending on whether a withdrawal is specified to be received as tokens vs shares (read more about "why" in [`EigenPodManager.md`](./EigenPodManager.md)):
  * `EigenPodManager` withdrawals received as shares: 
      * Shares ALWAYS go back to the originator of the withdrawal (rather than the `withdrawer` address). 
      * Shares are also delegated to the originator's Operator, rather than the `withdrawer's` Operator.
      * Shares received by the originator may be lower than the shares originally withdrawn if the originator has debt.
  * `EigenPodManager` withdrawals received as tokens:
      * Before the withdrawal can be completed, the originator needs to prove that a withdrawal occurred on the beacon chain (see [`EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodverifyandprocesswithdrawals)).
  
  *Effects*:
  * The hash of the `Withdrawal` is removed from the pending withdrawals
  * If `receiveAsTokens`:
      * See [`StrategyManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](./StrategyManager.md#withdrawsharesastokens)
      * See [`EigenPodManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerwithdrawsharesastokens)
  * If `!receiveAsTokens`:
      * For `StrategyManager` strategies:
          * Shares are awarded to the `withdrawer` and delegated to the `withdrawer's` Operator
          * See [`StrategyManager.addShares`](./StrategyManager.md#addshares)
      * For the native beacon chain ETH strategy (`EigenPodManager`):
          * Shares are awarded to `withdrawal.staker`, and delegated to the Staker's Operator
          * See [`EigenPodManager.addShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanageraddshares)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_EXIT_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE`
  * The hash of the passed-in `Withdrawal` MUST correspond to a pending withdrawal
      * At least `minWithdrawalDelayBlocks` MUST have passed before `completeQueuedWithdrawal` is called
      * For all strategies in the `Withdrawal`, at least `strategyWithdrawalDelayBlocks[strategy]` MUST have passed before `completeQueuedWithdrawal` is called
      * Caller MUST be the `withdrawer` specified in the `Withdrawal`
  * If `receiveAsTokens`:
      * The caller MUST pass in the underlying `IERC20[] tokens` being withdrawn in the appropriate order according to the strategies in the `Withdrawal`.
      * See [`StrategyManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](./StrategyManager.md#withdrawsharesastokens)
      * See [`EigenPodManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanagerwithdrawsharesastokens)
  * If `!receiveAsTokens`:
      * See [`StrategyManager.addShares`](./StrategyManager.md#addshares)
      * See [`EigenPodManager.addShares`](./EigenPodManager.md#eigenpodmanageraddshares)
  
  *As of M2*:
  * The `middlewareTimesIndex` parameter has to do with the Slasher, which currently does nothing. As of M2, this parameter has no bearing on anything and can be ignored.
  
  #### `completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  ```solidity
  function completeQueuedWithdrawals(
      Withdrawal[] calldata withdrawals,
      IERC20[][] calldata tokens,
      uint256[] calldata middlewareTimesIndexes,
      bool[] calldata receiveAsTokens
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EXIT_WITHDRAWAL_QUEUE) 
      nonReentrant
  ```
  
  This method is the plural version of [`completeQueuedWithdrawal`](#completequeuedwithdrawal).

  ### Accounting
  
  These methods are called by the `StrategyManager` and `EigenPodManager` to update delegated share accounting when a Staker's balance changes (e.g. due to a deposit):
  
  * [`DelegationManager.increaseDelegatedShares`](#increasedelegatedshares)
  * [`DelegationManager.decreaseDelegatedShares`](#decreasedelegatedshares)
  
  #### `increaseDelegatedShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function increaseDelegatedShares(
      address staker, 
      IStrategy strategy, 
      uint256 shares
  )
      external
      onlyStrategyManagerOrEigenPodManager
  ```
  
  Called by either the `StrategyManager` or `EigenPodManager` when a Staker's shares for one or more strategies increase. This method is called to ensure that if the Staker is delegated to an Operator, that Operator's share count reflects the increase.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategy`
  * `StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategyWithSignature`
  * `EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials`
  * `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`
  * `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*: If the Staker in question is delegated to an Operator, the Operator's shares for the `strategy` are increased.
  * This method is a no-op if the Staker is not delegated to an Operator.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be either the `StrategyManager` or `EigenPodManager`
  
  #### `decreaseDelegatedShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function decreaseDelegatedShares(
      address staker, 
      IStrategy strategy, 
      uint256 shares
  )
      external
      onlyStrategyManagerOrEigenPodManager
  ```
  
  Called by the `EigenPodManager` when a Staker's shares decrease. This method is called to ensure that if the Staker is delegated to an Operator, that Operator's share count reflects the decrease.
  
  *Entry Points*: This method may be called as a result of the following top-level function calls:
  * `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`
  * `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*: If the Staker in question is delegated to an Operator, the Operator's delegated balance for the `strategy` is decreased by `shares`
  * This method is a no-op if the Staker is not delegated to an Operator.
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be either the `StrategyManager` or `EigenPodManager` (although the `StrategyManager` doesn't use this method)

  Allows the Owner to set the overall minimum withdrawal delay for withdrawals concerning any strategy. The total time required for a withdrawal to be completable is at least `minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`. If any of the withdrawal's strategies have a higher per-strategy withdrawal delay, the time required is the maximum of these per-strategy delays.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets the global `minWithdrawalDelayBlocks`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Owner
  * The new value MUST NOT be greater than `MAX_WITHDRAWAL_DELAY_BLOCKS`

  The `EigenPodManager` and `EigenPod` contracts allow Stakers to restake beacon chain ETH which can then be delegated to Operators via the `DelegationManager`.
  
  The `EigenPodManager` is the entry point for this process, allowing Stakers to deploy an `EigenPod` and begin restaking. While actively restaking, a Staker uses their `EigenPod` to validate various beacon chain state proofs of validator balance and withdrawal status. When exiting, a Staker uses the `DelegationManager` to undelegate or queue a withdrawal from EigenLayer.
  
  `EigenPods` serve as the withdrawal credentials for one or more beacon chain validators controlled by a Staker. Their primary role is to validate beacon chain proofs for each of the Staker's validators. Beacon chain proofs are used to verify a validator's:
  * `EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials`: withdrawal credentials and effective balance
  * `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`: effective balance (when it changes)
  * `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`: withdrawable epoch, and processed withdrawals within historical block summary
  
  See [/proofs](./proofs/) for detailed documentation on each of the state proofs used in these methods. Additionally, proofs are checked against a beacon chain block root supplied by Succinct's Telepathy protocol ([docs link](https://docs.telepathy.xyz/)).
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  The functions of the `EigenPodManager` and `EigenPod` contracts are tightly linked. Rather than writing two separate docs pages, documentation for both contracts is included in this file. This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Depositing Into EigenLayer](#depositing-into-eigenlayer)
  * [Restaking Beacon Chain ETH](#restaking-beacon-chain-eth)
  * [Withdrawal Processing](#withdrawal-processing)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  * [Other Methods](#other-methods)
  
  #### Important State Variables
  
  * `EigenPodManager`:
      * `mapping(address => IEigenPod) public ownerToPod`: Tracks the deployed `EigenPod` for each Staker
      * `mapping(address => int256) public podOwnerShares`: Keeps track of the actively restaked beacon chain ETH for each Staker. 
          * In some cases, a beacon chain balance update may cause a Staker's balance to drop below zero. This is because when queueing for a withdrawal in the `DelegationManager`, the Staker's current shares are fully removed. If the Staker's beacon chain balance drops after this occurs, their `podOwnerShares` may go negative. This is a temporary change to account for the drop in balance, and is ultimately corrected when the withdrawal is finally processed.
          * Since balances on the consensus layer are stored only in Gwei amounts, the EigenPodManager enforces the invariant that `podOwnerShares` is always a whole Gwei amount for every staker, i.e. `podOwnerShares[staker] % 1e9 == 0` always.
  * `EigenPod`:
      * `_validatorPubkeyHashToInfo[bytes32] -> (ValidatorInfo)`: individual validators are identified within an `EigenPod` according to their public key hash. This mapping keeps track of the following for each validator:
          * `validatorStatus`: (`INACTIVE`, `ACTIVE`, `WITHDRAWN`)
          * `validatorIndex`: A `uint40` that is unique for each validator making a successful deposit via the deposit contract
          * `mostRecentBalanceUpdateTimestamp`: A timestamp that represents the most recent successful proof of the validator's effective balance
          * `restakedBalanceGwei`: set to the validator's balance.
      * `withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei`: When a Staker proves that a validator has exited from the beacon chain, the withdrawal amount is added to this variable. When completing a withdrawal of beacon chain ETH, the withdrawal amount is subtracted from this variable. See also:
          * [`DelegationManager`: "Undelegating and Withdrawing"](./DelegationManager.md#undelegating-and-withdrawing)
          * [`EigenPodManager`: "Withdrawal Processing"](#withdrawal-processing)
  
  #### Important Definitions
  
  * "Pod Owner": A Staker who has deployed an `EigenPod` is a Pod Owner. The terms are used interchangeably in this document.
      * Pod Owners can only deploy a single `EigenPod`, but can restake any number of beacon chain validators from the same `EigenPod`.
      * Pod Owners can delegate their `EigenPodManager` shares to Operators (via `DelegationManager`).
      * These shares correspond to the amount of provably-restaked beacon chain ETH held by the Pod Owner via their `EigenPod`.
  * `EigenPod`:
      * `_podWithdrawalCredentials() -> (bytes memory)`:
          * Gives `abi.encodePacked(bytes1(uint8(1)), bytes11(0), address(EigenPod))`
          * These are the `0x01` withdrawal credentials of the `EigenPod`, used as a validator's withdrawal credentials on the beacon chain.

  ### Depositing Into EigenLayer
  
  Before a Staker begins restaking beacon chain ETH, they need to deploy an `EigenPod`, stake, and start a beacon chain validator:
  * [`EigenPodManager.createPod`](#eigenpodmanagercreatepod)
  * [`EigenPodManager.stake`](#eigenpodmanagerstake)
      * [`EigenPod.stake`](#eigenpodstake)
  
  To complete the deposit process, the Staker needs to prove that the validator's withdrawal credentials are pointed at the `EigenPod`:
  * [`EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials`](#eigenpodverifywithdrawalcredentials)
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.createPod`
  
  ```solidity
  function createPod() external onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS) returns (address)
  ```
  
  Allows a Staker to deploy an `EigenPod` instance, if they have not done so already.
  
  Each Staker can only deploy a single `EigenPod` instance, but a single `EigenPod` can serve as the withdrawal credentials for any number of beacon chain validators. Each `EigenPod` is created using Create2 and the beacon proxy pattern, using the Staker's address as the Create2 salt.
  
  As part of the `EigenPod` deployment process, the Staker is made the Pod Owner, a permissioned role within the `EigenPod`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Create2 deploys `EigenPodManager.beaconProxyBytecode`, appending the `eigenPodBeacon` address as a constructor argument. `bytes32(msg.sender)` is used as the salt.
      * `address eigenPodBeacon` is an [OpenZeppelin v4.7.1 `UpgradableBeacon`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.7.1/contracts/proxy/beacon/UpgradeableBeacon.sol), whose implementation address points to the current `EigenPod` implementation
      * `beaconProxyBytecode` is the constructor code for an [OpenZeppelin v4.7.1 `BeaconProxy`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/v4.7.1/contracts/proxy/beacon/BeaconProxy.sol)
  * `EigenPod.initialize(msg.sender)`: initializes the pod, setting the caller as the Pod Owner and activating restaking for any validators pointed at the pod.
  * Maps the new pod to the Pod Owner (each address can only deploy a single `EigenPod`)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST NOT have deployed an `EigenPod` already
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS`
  
  *As of M2*:
  * `EigenPods` are initialized with restaking enabled by default (`hasRestaked = true`). Pods deployed before M2 may not have this enabled, and will need to call `EigenPod.activateRestaking()`.
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.stake`
  
  ```solidity
  function stake(
      bytes calldata pubkey, 
      bytes calldata signature, 
      bytes32 depositDataRoot
  ) 
      external 
      payable
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS)
  ```
  
  Allows a Staker to deposit 32 ETH into the beacon chain deposit contract, providing the credentials for the Staker's beacon chain validator. The `EigenPod.stake` method is called, which automatically calculates the correct withdrawal credentials for the pod and passes these to the deposit contract along with the 32 ETH.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Deploys and initializes an `EigenPod` on behalf of Staker, if this has not been done already
  * See [`EigenPod.stake`](#eigenpodstake)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS`
  * See [`EigenPod.stake`](#eigenpodstake)
  
  ##### `EigenPod.stake`
  
  ```solidity
  function stake(
      bytes calldata pubkey,
      bytes calldata signature,
      bytes32 depositDataRoot
  ) 
      external 
      payable 
      onlyEigenPodManager
  ```
  
  Handles the call to the beacon chain deposit contract. Only called via `EigenPodManager.stake`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Deposits 32 ETH into the beacon chain deposit contract, and provides the pod's address as the deposit's withdrawal credentials
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `EigenPodManager`
  * Call value MUST be 32 ETH
  * Deposit contract `deposit` method MUST succeed given the provided `pubkey`, `signature`, and `depositDataRoot`
  
  #### `EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyWithdrawalCredentials(
      uint64 oracleTimestamp,
      BeaconChainProofs.StateRootProof calldata stateRootProof,
      uint40[] calldata validatorIndices,
      bytes[] calldata validatorFieldsProofs,
      bytes32[][] calldata validatorFields
  )
      external
      onlyEigenPodOwner
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_CREDENTIALS)
      proofIsForValidTimestamp(oracleTimestamp)
      hasEnabledRestaking
  ```
  
  Once a Pod Owner has deposited ETH into the beacon chain deposit contract, they can call this method to "fully restake" one or more validators by proving the validator's withdrawal credentials are pointed at the `EigenPod`. This activation will mean that the ETH in those validators:
  * is awarded to the Staker/Pod Owner in `EigenPodManager.podOwnerShares`
  * is delegatable to an Operator (via the `DelegationManager`)
  
  For each successfully proven validator, that validator's status becomes `VALIDATOR_STATUS.ACTIVE`, and the sum of restakable ether across all newly-proven validators is provided to [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate), where it is added to the Pod Owner's shares. If the Pod Owner is delegated to an Operator via the `DelegationManager`, this sum is also added to the Operator's delegated shares for the beacon chain ETH strategy.
  
  For each validator the Pod Owner wants to verify, the Pod Owner must supply:
  * `validatorIndices`: their validator's `ValidatorIndex` (see [consensus specs](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/config/types/#validatorindex))
  * `validatorFields`: the fields of the `Validator` container associated with the validator (see [consensus specs](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/dependencies/#validator))
  * `stateRootProof`: a proof that will verify `stateRootProof.beaconStateRoot` against an oracle-provided beacon block root
  * `validatorFieldsProofs`: a proof that the `Validator` container belongs to the associated validator at the given `ValidatorIndex` within `stateRootProof.beaconStateRoot`
  * `oracleTimestamp`: a timestamp used to fetch a beacon block root from `EigenPodManager.beaconChainOracle`
  
  *Beacon chain proofs used*:
  * [`verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifystaterootagainstlatestblockroot)
  * [`verifyValidatorFields`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifyvalidatorfields)
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each validator (`_validatorPubkeyHashToInfo[pubkeyHash]`) the validator's info is set for the first time:
      * `VALIDATOR_STATUS` moves from `INACTIVE` to `ACTIVE`
      * `validatorIndex` is recorded
      * `mostRecentBalanceUpdateTimestamp` is set to the `oracleTimestamp` used to fetch the beacon block root
      * `restakedBalanceGwei` is set to the validator's effective balance
  * See [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Pod Owner
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_CREDENTIALS`
  * Pod MUST have enabled restaking
  * All input array lengths MUST be equal
  * `oracleTimestamp`:
      * MUST be greater than the `mostRecentWithdrawalTimestamp`
      * MUST be no more than `VERIFY_BALANCE_UPDATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (~4.5 hrs) old
      * MUST be queryable via `EigenPodManager.getBlockRootAtTimestamp` (fails if `stateRoot == 0`)
  * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot` MUST verify the provided `beaconStateRoot` against the oracle-provided `latestBlockRoot`
  * For each validator:
      * The validator's status MUST initially be `VALIDATOR_STATUS.INACTIVE`
      * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyValidatorFields` MUST verify the provided `validatorFields` against the `beaconStateRoot`
      * The aforementioned proofs MUST show that the validator's withdrawal credentials are set to the `EigenPod`
  * See [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)
  
  *As of M2*:
  * Restaking is enabled by default for pods deployed after M2. See `activateRestaking` for more info.

  ### Restaking Beacon Chain ETH
  
  At this point, a Staker/Pod Owner has deployed their `EigenPod`, started their beacon chain validator, and proven that its withdrawal credentials are pointed to their `EigenPod`. They are now free to delegate to an Operator (if they have not already), or start up + verify additional beacon chain validators that also withdraw to the same `EigenPod`.
  
  The primary method concerning actively restaked validators is:
  * [`EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`](#eigenpodverifybalanceupdates)
  
  #### `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyBalanceUpdates(
      uint64 oracleTimestamp,
      uint40[] calldata validatorIndices,
      BeaconChainProofs.StateRootProof calldata stateRootProof,
      bytes[] calldata validatorFieldsProofs,
      bytes32[][] calldata validatorFields
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_BALANCE_UPDATE)
  ```
  
  Anyone (not just the Pod Owner) may call this method with one or more valid balance update proofs to record beacon chain balance updates in one or more of the `EigenPod's` validators.
  
  A successful balance update proof updates the `EigenPod's` view of a validator's [effective balance](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/balances/). If the validator's effective balance has changed, the difference is sent to `EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`, which updates the Pod Owner's shares. If the Pod Owner is delegated to an Operator, this delta is also sent to the `DelegationManager` to update the Operator's delegated beacon chain ETH shares.
  
  Note that if a validator's effective balance has decreased, this method will result in shares being removed from the Pod Owner in `EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`. This may cause the Pod Owner's balance to go negative in some cases, representing a "deficit" that must be repaid before any withdrawals can be processed. One example flow where this might occur is:
  * Pod Owner calls `DelegationManager.undelegate`, which queues a withdrawal in the `DelegationManager`. The Pod Owner's shares are set to 0 while the withdrawal is in the queue.
  * Pod Owner's beacon chain ETH balance decreases (maybe due to slashing), and someone provides a proof of this to `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`. In this case, the Pod Owner will have negative shares in the `EigenPodManager`.
  * After a delay, the Pod Owner calls `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`. The negative shares are then repaid out of the withdrawn assets.
  
  For the validator whose balance should be updated, the caller must supply:
  * `validatorIndex`: the validator's `ValidatorIndex` (see [consensus specs](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/config/types/#validatorindex))
  * `stateRootProof`: a proof that will verify `stateRootProof.beaconStateRoot` against an oracle-provided beacon block root
  * `validatorFieldsProofs`: a proof that the `Validator` container belongs to the associated validator at the given `ValidatorIndex` within `stateRootProof.beaconStateRoot`
  * `validatorFields`: the fields of the `Validator` container associated with the validator (see [consensus specs](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/dependencies/#validator))
  * `oracleTimestamp`: a timestamp used to fetch a beacon block root from `EigenPodManager.beaconChainOracle`
  
  *Beacon chain proofs used*:
  * [`verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifystaterootagainstlatestblockroot)
  * [`verifyValidatorFields`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifyvalidatorfields)
  
  *Effects*:
  * Updates the validator's stored info:
      * `restakedBalanceGwei` is updated to the newly-proven effective balance
      * `mostRecentBalanceUpdateTimestamp` is set to the `oracleTimestamp` used to fetch the beacon block root
  * See [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_BALANCE_UPDATE`
  * Balance updates should only be made before a validator has fully exited. If the validator has exited, any further proofs should follow the `verifyAndProcessWithdrawals` path.
      * This is to prevent someone from providing a "balance update" on an exited validator that "proves" a balance of 0, when we want to process that update as a withdrawal instead.
  * `oracleTimestamp`:
      * MUST be no more than `VERIFY_BALANCE_UPDATE_WINDOW_SECONDS` (~4.5 hrs) old
      * MUST be newer than the validator's `mostRecentBalanceUpdateTimestamp`
      * MUST be queryable via `EigenPodManager.getBlockRootAtTimestamp` (fails if `stateRoot == 0`)
  * `validatorFields[0]` MUST be a pubkey hash corresponding to a validator whose withdrawal credentials have been proven, and is not yet withdrawn (`VALIDATOR_STATUS.ACTIVE`)
  * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot` MUST verify the provided `beaconStateRoot` against the oracle-provided `latestBlockRoot`
  * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyValidatorFields` MUST verify the provided `validatorFields` against the `beaconStateRoot`
  * See [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)
  
  ---
  
  ### Withdrawal Processing
  
  The `DelegationManager` is the entry point for all undelegation and withdrawals, which must be queued for a time before being completed. When a withdrawal is initiated, the following method is used:
  * [`EigenPodManager.removeShares`](#eigenpodmanagerremoveshares)
  
  When completing a queued undelegation or withdrawal, the `DelegationManager` calls one of these two methods:
  * [`EigenPodManager.addShares`](#eigenpodmanageraddshares)
  * [`EigenPodManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](#eigenpodmanagerwithdrawsharesastokens)
      * [`EigenPod.withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH`](#eigenpodwithdrawrestakedbeaconchaineth)
  
  If a Staker wishes to fully withdraw their beacon chain ETH (via `withdrawSharesAsTokens`), they need to exit their validator and prove the withdrawal *prior to* completing the queued withdrawal. They do so using this method:
  * [`EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`](#eigenpodverifyandprocesswithdrawals)
  
  Some withdrawals are sent to their destination via the `DelayedWithdrawalRouter`:
  * [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  * [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.claimDelayedWithdrawals`](#delayedwithdrawalrouterclaimdelayedwithdrawals)
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.removeShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function removeShares(
      address podOwner, 
      uint256 shares
  ) 
      external 
      onlyDelegationManager
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a Staker queues a withdrawal (or undelegates, which also queues a withdrawal). The shares are removed while the withdrawal is in the queue, and when the queue completes, the shares will either be re-awarded or withdrawn as tokens (`addShares` and `withdrawSharesAsTokens`, respectively).
  
  The Staker's share balance is decreased by the removed `shares`. 
  
  This method is not allowed to cause the `Staker's` balance to go negative. This prevents a Staker from queueing a withdrawal for more shares than they have (or more shares than they delegated to an Operator).
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.undelegate`
  * `DelegationManager.queueWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Removes `shares` from `podOwner's` share balance
  
  *Requirements*:
  * `podOwner` MUST NOT be zero
  * `shares` MUST NOT be negative when converted to `int256`
  * `shares` MUST NOT be greater than `podOwner's` share balance
  * `shares` MUST be a whole Gwei amount
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.addShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function addShares(
      address podOwner,
      uint256 shares
  ) 
      external 
      onlyDelegationManager 
      returns (uint256)
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a queued withdrawal is completed and the withdrawer specifies that they want to receive the withdrawal as "shares" (rather than as the underlying tokens). A Pod Owner might want to do this in order to change their delegated Operator without needing to fully exit their validators.
  
  Note that typically, shares from completed withdrawals are awarded to a `withdrawer` specified when the withdrawal is initiated in `DelegationManager.queueWithdrawals`. However, because beacon chain ETH shares are linked to proofs provided to a Pod Owner's `EigenPod`, this method is used to award shares to the original Pod Owner.
  
  If the Pod Owner has a share deficit (negative shares), the deficit is repaid out of the added `shares`. If the Pod Owner's positive share count increases, this change is returned to the `DelegationManager` to be delegated to the Pod Owner's Operator (if they have one).
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * The `podOwner's` share balance is increased by `shares`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * `podOwner` MUST NOT be zero
  * `shares` MUST NOT be negative when converted to an `int256`
  * `shares` MUST be a whole Gwei amount
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdrawSharesAsTokens(
      address podOwner, 
      address destination, 
      uint256 shares
  ) 
      external 
      onlyDelegationManager
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a queued withdrawal is completed and the withdrawer specifies that they want to receive the withdrawal as tokens (rather than shares). This can be used to "fully exit" some amount of beacon chain ETH and send it to a recipient (via `EigenPod.withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH`).
  
  Note that because this method entails withdrawing and sending beacon chain ETH, two conditions must be met for this method to succeed: (i) the ETH being withdrawn should already be in the `EigenPod`, and (ii) the beacon chain withdrawals responsible for the ETH should already be proven.
  
  This means that before completing their queued withdrawal, a Pod Owner needs to prove their beacon chain withdrawals via `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`.
  
  Also note that, like `addShares`, if the original Pod Owner has a share deficit (negative shares), the deficit is repaid out of the withdrawn `shares` before any native ETH is withdrawn.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * If `podOwner's` share balance is negative, `shares` are added until the balance hits 0
      * Any remaining shares are withdrawn and sent to `destination` (see [`EigenPod.withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH`](#eigenpodwithdrawrestakedbeaconchaineth))
  
  *Requirements*:
  * `podOwner` MUST NOT be zero
  * `destination` MUST NOT be zero
  * `shares` MUST NOT be negative when converted to an `int256`
  * `shares` MUST be a whole Gwei amount
  * See [`EigenPod.withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH`](#eigenpodwithdrawrestakedbeaconchaineth)
  
  ##### `EigenPod.withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdrawRestakedBeaconChainETH(
      address recipient, 
      uint256 amountWei
  ) 
      external 
      onlyEigenPodManager
  ```
  
  The `EigenPodManager` calls this method when withdrawing a Pod Owner's shares as tokens (native ETH). The input `amountWei` is converted to Gwei and subtracted from `withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei`, which tracks Gwei that has been provably withdrawn (via `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`).
  
  As such:
  * If a withdrawal has not been proven that sufficiently raises `withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei`, this method will revert.
  * If the `EigenPod` does not have `amountWei` available to transfer, this method will revert
  
  *Effects*:
  * Decreases the pod's `withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei` by `amountWei / GWEI_TO_WEI`
  * Sends `amountWei` ETH to `recipient`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * `amountWei / GWEI_TO_WEI` MUST NOT be greater than the proven `withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei`
  * Pod MUST have at least `amountWei` ETH balance
  * `recipient` MUST NOT revert when transferred `amountWei`
  * `amountWei` MUST be a whole Gwei amount
  
  #### `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyAndProcessWithdrawals(
      uint64 oracleTimestamp,
      BeaconChainProofs.StateRootProof calldata stateRootProof,
      BeaconChainProofs.WithdrawalProof[] calldata withdrawalProofs,
      bytes[] calldata validatorFieldsProofs,
      bytes32[][] calldata validatorFields,
      bytes32[][] calldata withdrawalFields
  ) 
      external 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_WITHDRAWAL) 
      onlyNotFrozen
  ```
  
  Anyone (not just the Pod Owner) can call this method to prove that one or more validators associated with an `EigenPod` have performed a full or partial withdrawal from the beacon chain. 
  
  Whether each withdrawal is a full or partial withdrawal is determined by the validator's "withdrawable epoch" in the `Validator` container given by `validatorFields` (see [consensus specs](https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/dependencies/#validator)). If the withdrawal proof timestamp is after this epoch, the withdrawal is a full withdrawal.
  * Partial withdrawals are performed automatically by the beacon chain when a validator has an effective balance over 32 ETH. This method can be used to prove that these withdrawals occurred, allowing the Pod Owner to withdraw the excess ETH (via [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)).
  * Full withdrawals are performed when a Pod Owner decides to fully exit a validator from the beacon chain. To do this, the Pod Owner should follow these steps: 
      1. Undelegate or queue a withdrawal (via the `DelegationManager`: ["Undelegating and Withdrawing"](./DelegationManager.md#undelegating-and-withdrawing))
      2. Exit their validator from the beacon chain and provide a proof to this method
      3. Complete their withdrawal (via [`DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`](./DelegationManager.md#completequeuedwithdrawal)).
  
  If the Pod Owner only exits their validator, the ETH of the pod owner is still staked through EigenLayer and can be used to service AVSs, even though their ETH has been withdrawn from the beacon chain. The protocol allows for this edge case. 
  
  *Beacon chain proofs used*:
  * [`verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifystaterootagainstlatestblockroot)
  * [`verifyWithdrawal`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifywithdrawal)
  * [`verifyValidatorFields`](./proofs/BeaconChainProofs.md#beaconchainproofsverifyvalidatorfields)
  
  *Effects*:
  * For each proven withdrawal:
      * The validator in question is recorded as having a proven withdrawal at the timestamp given by `withdrawalProof.timestampRoot`
          * This is to prevent the same withdrawal from being proven twice
      * If this is a full withdrawal:
          * Any withdrawal amount in excess of `MAX_RESTAKED_BALANCE_GWEI_PER_VALIDATOR` is immediately withdrawn (see [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal))
              * The remainder (`MAX_RESTAKED_BALANCE_GWEI_PER_VALIDATOR`) must be withdrawn through the `DelegationManager's` withdrawal flow, but in the meantime is added to `EigenPod.withdrawableRestakedExecutionLayerGwei`
          * If the amount being withdrawn is not equal to the current accounted-for validator balance, a `shareDelta` is calculated to be sent to ([`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)).
          * The validator's info is updated to reflect its `WITHDRAWN` status, and `restakedBalanceGwei` is set to 0
      * If this is a partial withdrawal:
          * The withdrawal amount is added to `sumOfPartialWithdrawalsClaimedGwei`
          * The withdrawal amount is withdrawn (via [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal))
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_WITHDRAWAL`
  * All input array lengths MUST be equal
  * `oracleTimestamp` MUST be queryable via `EigenPodManager.getBlockRootAtTimestamp` (fails if `stateRoot == 0`)
  * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot` MUST verify the provided `beaconStateRoot` against the oracle-provided `latestBlockRoot`
  * For each withdrawal being proven:
      * The time of the withdrawal (`withdrawalProof.timestampRoot`) must be AFTER the `EigenPod's` `mostRecentWithdrawalTimestamp`
      * The validator MUST be in either status: `ACTIVE` or `WITHDRAWN`
          * `WITHDRAWN` is permitted because technically, it's possible to deposit additional ETH into an exited validator and have the ETH be auto-withdrawn.
          * If the withdrawal is a full withdrawal, only `ACTIVE` is permitted
      * The validator MUST NOT have already proven a withdrawal at the `withdrawalProof.timestampRoot`
      * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyWithdrawal` MUST verify the provided `withdrawalFields` against the provided `beaconStateRoot`
      * `BeaconChainProofs.verifyValidatorFields` MUST verify the provided `validatorFields` against the `beaconStateRoot`

      external 
      payable 
      onlyEigenPod(podOwner) 
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DELAYED_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIMS)
  ```
  
  Used by `EigenPods` to queue a withdrawal of beacon chain ETH that can be claimed by a `recipient` after `withdrawalDelayBlocks` have passed.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Creates a `DelayedWithdrawal` for the `recipient` in the amount of `msg.value`, starting at the current block
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_DELAYED_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIMS`
  * Caller MUST be the `EigenPod` associated with the `podOwner`
  * `recipient` MUST NOT be zero
  
  #### `DelayedWithdrawalRouter.claimDelayedWithdrawals`
  
  ```solidity
  function claimDelayedWithdrawals(

  ```
  
  After `withdrawalDelayBlocks`, withdrawals can be claimed using these methods. Claims may be processed on behalf of someone else by passing their address in as the `recipient`. Otherwise, claims are processed on behalf of `msg.sender`.
  
  This method loops over up to `maxNumberOfDelayedWithdrawalsToClaim` withdrawals, tallys each withdrawal amount, and sends the total to the `recipient`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Updates the `recipient's` `delayedWithdrawalsCompleted`
  * Sends ETH from completed withdrawals to the `recipient`
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_DELAYED_WITHDRAWAL_CLAIMS`

  ### Other Methods
  
  This section details various methods that don't fit well into other sections.
  
  Stakers' balance updates are accounted for when the Staker's `EigenPod` calls this method:
  * [`EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`](#eigenpodmanagerrecordbeaconchainethbalanceupdate)
  
  *For pods deployed prior to M2*, the following methods are callable:
  * [`EigenPod.activateRestaking`](#eigenpodactivaterestaking)
  * [`EigenPod.withdrawBeforeRestaking`](#eigenpodwithdrawbeforerestaking)
  
  The `EigenPod` also includes two token recovery mechanisms:
  * [`EigenPod.withdrawNonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei`](#eigenpodwithdrawnonbeaconchainethbalancewei)
  * [`EigenPod.recoverTokens`](#eigenpodrecovertokens)
  
  #### `EigenPodManager.recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate`
  
  ```solidity
  function recordBeaconChainETHBalanceUpdate(
      address podOwner,
      int256 sharesDelta
  ) 
      external 
      onlyEigenPod(podOwner) 
      nonReentrant
  ```
  
  This method is called by an `EigenPod` during a balance update or withdrawal. It accepts a positive or negative `sharesDelta`, which is added/subtracted against the Pod Owner's shares.
  
  If the Pod Owner is not in undelegation limbo and is delegated to an Operator, the `sharesDelta` is also sent to the `DelegationManager` to either increase or decrease the Operator's delegated shares.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `EigenPod.verifyWithdrawalCredentials`
  * `EigenPod.verifyBalanceUpdates`
  * `EigenPod.verifyAndProcessWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Adds or removes `sharesDelta` from the Pod Owner's shares
  * If the Pod Owner is NOT in undelegation limbo:
      * If `sharesDelta` is negative: see [`DelegationManager.decreaseDelegatedShares`](./DelegationManager.md#decreasedelegatedshares)
      * If `sharesDelta` is positive: see [`DelegationManager.increaseDelegatedShares`](./DelegationManager.md#increasedelegatedshares)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `EigenPod` associated with the passed-in `podOwner`
  * `sharesDelta`: 
      * MUST NOT be 0
      * If negative, `sharesDelta` MUST NOT remove more shares than the Pod Owner has
      * MUST be a whole Gwei amount
  
  #### `EigenPod.activateRestaking`
  
  ```solidity
  function activateRestaking()
      external
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_EIGENPODS_VERIFY_CREDENTIALS)
      onlyEigenPodOwner
      hasNeverRestaked
  ```
  
  Note: This method is only callable on pods deployed before M2. After M2, restaking is enabled by default. 
  
  `activateRestaking` allows a Pod Owner to designate their pod (and any future ETH sent to it) as being restaked. Calling this method first withdraws any ETH in the `EigenPod` via the `DelayedWithdrawalRouter`, and then prevents further calls to `withdrawBeforeRestaking`.
  
  Withdrawing any future ETH sent via beacon chain withdrawal to the `EigenPod` requires providing beacon chain state proofs. However, ETH sent to the pod's `receive` function should be withdrawable without proofs (see [`withdrawNonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei`](#eigenpodwithdrawnonbeaconchainethbalancewei)).
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets `hasRestaked = true`
  * Sets the pod's `nonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei` to 0 (only incremented in the fallback function)
  * Updates the pod's most recent withdrawal timestamp to the current time
  * See [DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Pod Owner
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NEW_EIGENPODS`
  * Pod MUST NOT have already activated restaking
  * See [DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  *As of M2*: restaking is automatically activated for newly-deployed `EigenPods` (`hasRestaked = true`). However, for `EigenPods` deployed *before* M2, restaking may not be active (unless the Pod Owner has called this method).
  
  #### `EigenPod.withdrawBeforeRestaking`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdrawBeforeRestaking() 
      external 
      onlyEigenPodOwner 
      hasNeverRestaked
  ```
  
  Note: This method is only callable on pods deployed before M2. After M2, restaking is enabled by default. 
  
  Allows the Pod Owner to withdraw any ETH in the `EigenPod` via the `DelayedWithdrawalRouter`, assuming restaking has not yet been activated. See [`EigenPod.activateRestaking`](#eigenpodactivaterestaking) for more details.
  
  *Effects*:
  * Sets the pod's `nonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei` to 0 (only incremented in the fallback function)
  * Updates the pod's most recent withdrawal timestamp to the current time
  * See [DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the Pod Owner
  * Pod MUST NOT have already activated restaking
  * See [DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  *As of M2*: restaking is automatically activated for newly-deployed `EigenPods`, making this method uncallable for pods deployed after M2. However, for `EigenPods` deployed *before* M2, restaking may not be active, and this method may be callable.
  
  #### `EigenPod.withdrawNonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdrawNonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei(
      address recipient,
      uint256 amountToWithdraw
  ) 
      external 
      onlyEigenPodOwner
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_NON_PROOF_WITHDRAWALS)
  ```
  
  Allows the Pod Owner to withdraw ETH accidentally sent to the contract's `receive` function.
  
  The `receive` function updates `nonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei`, which this function uses to calculate how much can be withdrawn.
  
  Withdrawals from this function are sent via the `DelayedWithdrawalRouter`, and can be claimed by the passed-in `recipient`.
  
  *Effects:*
  * Decrements `nonBeaconChainETHBalanceWei`
  * Sends `amountToWithdraw` wei to [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  *Requirements:*
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NON_PROOF_WITHDRAWALS`
  * Caller MUST be the Pod Owner
  * `amountToWithdraw` MUST NOT be greater than the amount sent to the contract's `receive` function
  * See [`DelayedWithdrawalRouter.createDelayedWithdrawal`](#delayedwithdrawalroutercreatedelayedwithdrawal)
  
  #### `EigenPod.recoverTokens`
  
  ```solidity
  function recoverTokens(
      IERC20[] memory tokenList,
      uint256[] memory amountsToWithdraw,
      address recipient
  ) 
      external 
      onlyEigenPodOwner
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_NON_PROOF_WITHDRAWALS)
  ```
  
  Allows the Pod Owner to rescue ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the `EigenPod`.
  
  *Effects:*
  * Calls `transfer` on each of the ERC20's in `tokenList`, sending the corresponding `amountsToWithdraw` to the `recipient`
  
  *Requirements:*
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_NON_PROOF_WITHDRAWALS`
  * `tokenList` and `amountsToWithdraw` MUST have equal lengths
  * Caller MUST be the Pod Owner
  
  
  // contracts/lib/eigenlayer-middleware/lib/eigenlayer-contracts/docs/core/StrategyManager.md
  ## StrategyManager
  
  | File | Type | Proxy |
  | -------- | -------- | -------- |
  | [`StrategyManager.sol`](../../src/contracts/core/StrategyManager.sol) | Singleton | Transparent proxy |
  | [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.sol`](../../src/contracts/strategies/StrategyBaseTVLLimits.sol) | 3 instances (for cbETH, rETH, stETH) | Transparent proxy |
  
  The primary function of the `StrategyManager` is to handle accounting for individual Stakers as they deposit and withdraw LSTs from their corresponding strategies. It is responsible for (i) allowing Stakers to deposit LSTs into the corresponding strategy, (ii) allowing the `DelegationManager` to remove shares when a Staker queues a withdrawal, and (iii) allowing the `DelegationManager` to complete a withdrawal by either adding shares back to the Staker or withdrawing the shares as tokens via the corresponding strategy.
  
  As of M2, several LSTs are supported and each has its own instance of `StrategyBaseTVLLimits`. Each `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` has two main functions (`deposit` and `withdraw`), both of which can only be called by the `StrategyManager`. These `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` contracts are fairly simple deposit/withdraw contracts that hold tokens deposited by Stakers. Because these strategies are essentially extensions of the `StrategyManager`, their functions are documented in this file (see below).
  
  #### High-level Concepts
  
  This document organizes methods according to the following themes (click each to be taken to the relevant section):
  * [Depositing Into Strategies](#depositing-into-strategies)
  * [Withdrawal Processing](#withdrawal-processing)
  * [Strategies](#strategies)
  * [System Configuration](#system-configuration)
  
  #### Important state variables
  
  * `mapping(address => mapping(IStrategy => uint256)) public stakerStrategyShares`: Tracks the current balance a Staker holds in a given strategy. Updated on deposit/withdraw.
  * `mapping(address => IStrategy[]) public stakerStrategyList`: Maintains a list of the strategies a Staker holds a nonzero number of shares in.
      * Updated as needed when Stakers deposit and withdraw: if a Staker has a zero balance in a Strategy, it is removed from the list. Likewise, if a Staker deposits into a Strategy and did not previously have a balance, it is added to the list.
  * `mapping(IStrategy => bool) public strategyIsWhitelistedForDeposit`: The `strategyWhitelister` is (as of M2) a permissioned role that can be changed by the contract owner. The `strategyWhitelister` has currently whitelisted 3 `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` contracts in this mapping, one for each supported LST.
  * `mapping(IStrategy => bool) public thirdPartyTransfersForbidden`: The `strategyWhitelister` can disable third party transfers for a given strategy. If `thirdPartyTransfersForbidden[strategy] == true`:
      * Users cannot deposit on behalf of someone else (see [`depositIntoStrategyWithSignature`](#depositintostrategywithsignature)). 
      * Users cannot withdraw on behalf of someone else. (see [`DelegationManager.queueWithdrawals`](./DelegationManager.md#queuewithdrawals)) 
  
  #### Helpful definitions
  
  * `stakerStrategyListLength(address staker) -> (uint)`:
      * Gives `stakerStrategyList[staker].length`
      * Used (especially by the `DelegationManager`) to determine whether a Staker has shares in any strategy in the `StrategyManager` (will be 0 if not)
  
  ---
  
  ### Depositing Into Strategies
  
  The following methods are called by Stakers as they (i) deposit LSTs into strategies to receive shares:
  
  * [`StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategy`](#depositintostrategy)
  * [`StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategyWithSignature`](#depositintostrategywithsignature)
  
  Withdrawals are performed through the `DelegationManager` (see [`DelegationManager.md`](./DelegationManager.md)).
  
  #### `depositIntoStrategy`
  
  ```solidity
  function depositIntoStrategy(
      IStrategy strategy, 
      IERC20 token, 
      uint256 amount
  )
      external
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DEPOSITS)
      onlyNotFrozen(msg.sender)
      nonReentrant
      returns (uint256 shares)
  ```
  
  Allows a Staker to deposit some `amount` of `token` into the specified `strategy` in exchange for shares of that strategy. The underlying `strategy` must be one of the whitelisted `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` instances, and the `token` being deposited must correspond to that `strategy's` underlying token (cbETH, rETH, or stETH).
  
  The number of shares received is calculated by the `strategy` using an internal exchange rate that depends on the previous number of tokens deposited.
  
  If the Staker is delegated to an Operator, the Operator's delegated shares are increased in the `DelegationManager`.
  
  *Effects*:
  * `token.safeTransferFrom`: Transfers `amount` of `token` to `strategy` on behalf of the caller.
  * See [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.deposit`](#strategybasetvllimitsdeposit)
  * `StrategyManager` awards the Staker with the newly-created shares 
  * See [`DelegationManager.increaseDelegatedShares`](./DelegationManager.md#increasedelegatedshares)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_DEPOSITS`
  * Caller MUST allow at least `amount` of `token` to be transferred by `StrategyManager` to the strategy
  * `strategy` in question MUST be whitelisted for deposits. 
  * See [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.deposit`](#strategybasetvllimitsdeposit)
  
  #### `depositIntoStrategyWithSignature`
  
  ```solidity
  function depositIntoStrategyWithSignature(
      IStrategy strategy,
      IERC20 token,
      uint256 amount,
      address staker,
      uint256 expiry,
      bytes memory signature
  )
      external
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DEPOSITS)
      onlyNotFrozen(staker)
      nonReentrant
      returns (uint256 shares)
  ```
  
  *Effects*: See `depositIntoStrategy` above. Additionally:
  * The Staker's nonce is incremented
  
  *Requirements*: See `depositIntoStrategy` above. Additionally:
  * Caller MUST provide a valid, unexpired signature over the correct fields
  * `thirdPartyTransfersForbidden[strategy]` MUST be false
  
  ---
  
  ### Withdrawal Processing
  
  These methods are callable ONLY by the `DelegationManager`, and are used when processing undelegations and withdrawals:
  * [`StrategyManager.removeShares`](#removeshares)
  * [`StrategyManager.addShares`](#addshares)
  * [`StrategyManager.withdrawSharesAsTokens`](#withdrawsharesastokens)
  
  See [`DelegationManager.md`](./DelegationManager.md) for more context on how these methods are used.
  
  #### `removeShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function removeShares(
      address staker,
      IStrategy strategy,
      uint256 shares
  )
      external
      onlyDelegationManager
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a Staker queues a withdrawal (or undelegates, which also queues a withdrawal). The shares are removed while the withdrawal is in the queue, and when the queue completes, the shares will either be re-awarded or withdrawn as tokens (`addShares` and `withdrawSharesAsTokens`, respectively).
  
  The Staker's share balance for the `strategy` is decreased by the removed `shares`. If this causes the Staker's share balance to hit zero, the `strategy` is removed from the Staker's strategy list.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.undelegate`
  * `DelegationManager.queueWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * The Staker's share balance for the given `strategy` is decreased by the given `shares`
      * If this causes the balance to hit zero, the `strategy` is removed from the Staker's strategy list
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `DelegationManager`
  * `staker` parameter MUST NOT be zero
  * `shares` parameter MUST NOT be zero
  * `staker` MUST have at least `shares` balance for the given `strategy`
  
  #### `addShares`
  
  ```solidity
  function addShares(
      address staker,
      IStrategy strategy,
      uint256 shares
  ) 
      external 
      onlyDelegationManager
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a queued withdrawal is completed and the withdrawer specifies that they want to receive the withdrawal as "shares" (rather than as the underlying tokens). In this case, the `shares` originally removed (via `removeShares`) are awarded to the `staker` passed in by the `DelegationManager`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * The `staker's` share balance for the given `strategy` is increased by `shares`
      * If the prior balance was zero, the `strategy` is added to the `staker's` strategy list
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `DelegationManager`
  * `staker` parameter MUST NOT be zero
  * `shares` parameter MUST NOT be zero
  
  #### `withdrawSharesAsTokens`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdrawSharesAsTokens(
      address recipient,
      IStrategy strategy,
      uint shares,
      IERC20 token
  )
      external
      onlyDelegationManager
  ```
  
  The `DelegationManager` calls this method when a queued withdrawal is completed and the withdrawer specifies that they want to receive the withdrawal as the tokens underlying the shares. In this case, the `shares` originally removed (via `removeShares`) are converted to tokens within the `strategy` and sent to the `recipient`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * Calls [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.withdraw`](#strategybasetvllimitswithdraw)
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `DelegationManager`
  * See [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.withdraw`](#strategybasetvllimitswithdraw)
  
  ---
  
  ### Strategies
  
  `StrategyBaseTVLLimits` only has two methods of note, and both can only be called by the `StrategyManager`. Documentation for these methods are included below, rather than in a separate file:
  * [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.deposit`](#strategybasetvllimitsdeposit)
  * [`StrategyBaseTVLLimits.withdraw`](#strategybasetvllimitswithdraw)
  
  #### `StrategyBaseTVLLimits.deposit`
  
  ```solidity
  function deposit(
      IERC20 token, 
      uint256 amount
  )
      external
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_DEPOSITS)
      onlyStrategyManager
      returns (uint256 newShares)
  ```
  
  The `StrategyManager` calls this method when Stakers deposit LSTs into a strategy. At the time this method is called, the tokens have already been transferred to the strategy. The role of this method is to (i) calculate the number of shares the deposited tokens represent according to the exchange rate, and (ii) add the new shares to the strategy's recorded total shares.
  
  The new shares created are returned to the `StrategyManager` to be added to the Staker's strategy share balance.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategy`
  * `StrategyManager.depositIntoStrategyWithSignature`
  
  *Effects*:
  * `StrategyBaseTVLLimits.totalShares` is increased to account for the new shares created by the deposit
  
  *Requirements*:
  * Caller MUST be the `StrategyManager`
  * Pause status MUST NOT be set: `PAUSED_DEPOSITS`
  * The passed-in `token` MUST match the strategy's `underlyingToken`
  * The token amount being deposited MUST NOT exceed the per-deposit cap
  * After deposit, the strategy's current token balance MUST NOT exceed the total-deposit cap
  * When converted to shares via the strategy's exchange rate, the `amount` of `token` deposited MUST represent at least 1 new share for the depositor
  
  #### `StrategyBaseTVLLimits.withdraw`
  
  ```solidity
  function withdraw(
      address recipient, 
      IERC20 token, 
      uint256 amountShares
  )
      external
      onlyWhenNotPaused(PAUSED_WITHDRAWALS)
      onlyStrategyManager
  ```
  
  The `StrategyManager` calls this method when a queued withdrawal is completed and the withdrawer has specified they would like to convert their withdrawn shares to tokens. 
  
  This method converts the withdrawal shares back into tokens using the strategy's exchange rate. The strategy's total shares are decreased to reflect the withdrawal before transferring the tokens to the `recipient`.
  
  *Entry Points*:
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawal`
  * `DelegationManager.completeQueuedWithdrawals`
  
  *Effects*:
  * `StrategyBaseTVLLimits.totalShares` is decreased to account for the shares being withdrawn
  * `underlyingToken.safeTransfer` is called to transfer the tokens to the `recipient`
  
  *Requirements*:

  ### Important Details About Proofs
  #### How Indices Are Calculated
  To prove a leaf in a merkle tree, you need several things - A proof, the leaf, the index of that leaf in a list of leaves and the root you are proving against.  The beacon state can be represented as several merkle trees stacked on top of each other, i.e., each leaf in the topmost tree is a root of another tree and so on.  This means that theoretically, proving most things about the beacon state involves making multiple proofs about each of the merkle trees that are stacked on top of each other.  
  
  However there is a way we can combine these proofs into a single proof.  This is by concatenating each of the individual proofs into one large proof and proving that against the topmost root.  However, how do we calculate the "index" for this mega-proof?
  
  The idea is simple, in a Merkle tree, every node has two children: left (or 0) and right (or 1). Starting from the root and moving down to a specific leaf, you can interpret each bit in the binary representation of the leaf's index as an instruction to traverse left (for 0) or right (for 1).  The length of a binary representation of an index is just `log(num_leaves) = height_of_the tree`.  
  
  Taking an example, let's say I had one merkle tree A whose Nth leaf was the root of merkle tree B.  So to calculate the index for the Mth leaf in B against the root of A, the index would be:
  `index_B_against_A = N << height_of_merkle_tree_B | M`.  In the image below, the blue nodes indicate the path we are trying to prove, the pink nodes are nodes in merkle tree B, which is a subtree of merkle tree A.
  
  ![Sample Merkle Tree](../../images/samplemerkle.png)
  
  Below are the explanations of each individual proof function that we use to prove various attributes about the state of the beacon chain and validators who are restaking via the EigenPods subprotocol.
  #### `BeaconChainProofs.verifyValidatorFields`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyValidatorFields(
      bytes32 beaconStateRoot,
      bytes32[] calldata validatorFields,
      bytes calldata validatorFieldsProof,
      uint40 validatorIndex
  ) 
      internal
  ```
  Verifies the proof of a provided [validator container](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#validator) against the beacon state root.  This proof can be used to verify any field in the validator container.  In the EigenPods system, this proof is used to prove a validator's withdrawal credentials as well as their effective balance.  Below is a diagram that illustrates exactly how the proof is structured relative to the [beacon state object](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#beaconstate).  
  
  ![Verify Validator Fields Proof Structure](../../images/Withdrawal_Credential_Proof.png)
  
  
  #### `BeaconChainProofs.verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyStateRootAgainstLatestBlockRoot(
      bytes32 latestBlockRoot,
      bytes32 beaconStateRoot,
      bytes calldata stateRootProof
  ) 
      internal
  ```
  Verifies the proof of a beacon state root against the oracle provided block root.  Every [beacon block](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beaconblock) in the beacon state contains the state root corresponding with that block.  Thus to prove anything against a state root, we must first prove the state root against the corresponding oracle block root.
  
  ![Verify State Root Proof Structure](../../images/staterootproof.png)
  
  
  #### `BeaconChainProofs.verifyWithdrawal`
  
  ```solidity
  function verifyWithdrawal(
      bytes32 beaconStateRoot,
      bytes32[] calldata withdrawalFields,
      WithdrawalProof calldata withdrawalProof,
      uint64 denebForkTimestamp
  ) 
      internal
  ```
  Verifies a withdrawal, either [full or partial](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/deposits-withdrawals/withdrawal-processing/#partial-and-full-withdrawals), of a validator.  There are a maximum of 16 withdrawals per block in the consensus layer.  This proof proves the inclusion of a given [withdrawal](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#withdrawal) in the block for a given slot.  
  
  One important note is that we use [`historical_summaries`](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#historical-summaries-updates) to prove the blocks that contain withdrawals.  Each new [historical summary](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/capella/beacon-chain.md#historicalsummary) is added every 8192 slots, i.e., if `slot % 8192 = 0`, then `slot.state_roots` and `slot.block_roots` are merkleized and are used to create the latest `historical_summaries` entry.
  
  This method also uses `denebForkTimestamp` to determine the height of the execution payload header field tree.

  # Purpose
  This document aims to describe and summarize how actively validated services (AVSs) building on EigenLayer interact with the core EigenLayer protocol. Currently, this doc explains how AVS developers can use the current** APIs for: 
  - enabling operators to opt-in to the AVS,
  - enabling operators to opt-out (withdraw stake) from the AVS,
  - enabling operators to continuously update their commitments to middlewares, and
  - enabling AVS to freeze operators for the purpose of slashing (the corresponding unfreeze actions are determined by the veto committee).
  
  <p align="center"><b><font size="+1">
  🚧 ** The Slasher contract is under active development and its interface is expected to change. We recommend writing slashing logic without integrating with the Slasher at this point in time. 🚧
  </font></b><p>
  
  We are currently in the process of implementing the API for payment flow from AVSs to operators in EigenLayer. Details of this API will be added to this document in the near future.
  
  The following figure summarizes the scope of this document: 
  ![Doc Outline](../images/middleware_outline_doc.png)
  
  
  # Introduction
  In designing EigenLayer, the EigenLabs team aspired to make minimal assumptions about the structure of AVSs built on top of it. If you are getting started looking at EigenLayer's codebase, the `Slasher.sol` contains most of the logic that actually mediates the interactions between EigenLayer and AVSs. Additionally, there is a general-purpose [/middleware/ folder][middleware-folder-link], which contains code that can be extended, used directly, or consulted as a reference in building an AVS on top of EigenLayer. Note that there will be a single, EigenLayer-owned, `Slasher.sol` contract, but all the `middleware` contracts are AVS-specific and need to be deployed separately by AVS teams.
  
  ## Important Terminology
  - **Tasks** - A task in EigenLayer is the smallest unit of work that operators commit to perform when serving an AVS. These tasks may be associated with one or more slashing conditions applicable to the AVS. 
  - **Strategies** - A strategy in EigenLayer is a contract that holds staker deposits, i.e. it controls one or more asset(s) that can be restaked. At launch EigenLayer will feature only simple strategies which may hold a single token. However, EigenLayer's strategy design is flexible and open, and in the future strategies could be deployed which implement more complex logic, including DeFi integrations. 
  - **Quorums** - A quorum in EigenLayer is a grouping of specific kinds of stake who opt into an AVS while satisfying a particular trait. Examples of such traits could be stETH stakers or native stakers.  The purpose of having a quorum is that an AVS can customize the makeup of their security offering by choosing which kinds of stake/security they would like to utilize.  
  
  # Key Design Considerations
  1. *Decomposition into "Tasks"*: <br/>
      EigenLayer assumes that an AVS manages tasks that are executed over time by a registered operator. Each task is associated with the time period during which the AVS's operators' stakes are placed "at stake", i.e. potentially subject to slashing. Examples of tasks could be:
      - Hosting and serving a “DataStore” in the context of EigenDA
      - Posting a state root of another blockchain for a bridge service
  
  2. *Stake is "At Stake" on Tasks for a Finite Duration*: <br/>
      It is assumed that every task (eventually) resolves. Each operator places their stake in EigenLayer “at stake” on the tasks that they perform. In order to “release” the stake (e.g. so the operator can withdraw their funds), these tasks need to eventually resolve. It is RECOMMENDED, but not required that a predefined duration is specified in the AVS contract for each task. As a guideline, the EigenLabs team believes that the duration of a task should be aligned with the longest reasonable duration that would be acceptable for an operator to keep funds “at stake”. An AVS builder should recognize that extending the duration of a task may impose significant negative externalities on the stakers of EigenLayer, and may disincentivize operators from opting-in to serving their application (so that they can attract more delegated stake).
  
  3. *Services Slash Only Objectively Attributable Behavior*: <br/>
      EigenLayer is built to support slashing as a result of an on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable action. An AVS SHOULD slash in EigenLayer only for such provable and attributable behavior. It is expected that operators will be very hesitant to opt-in to services that slash for other types of behavior, and other services may even choose to exclude operators who have opted-in to serving one or more AVSs with such “subjective slashing conditions”, as these slashing conditions present a significant challenge for risk modeling, and may be perceived as more dangerous in general. Some examples of on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable behavior: 
      - double-signing a block in Ethereum, but NOT inactivity leak; 
      - proofs-of-custody in EigenDA, but NOT a node ceasing to serve data; 
      - a node in a light-node-bridge AVS signing an invalid block from another chain.
  
  4. *Single Point-of-Interaction for Services and EigenLayer*: <br/>
      It is assumed that services have a single contract that coordinates the service’s communications sent to EigenLayer. This contract – referred to as the ServiceManager – informs EigenLayer of operator registration, updates, and deregistration, as well as signaling to EigenLayer when an operator should be slashed (frozen). An AVS has full control over how it splits the actual logic involved, but is expected to route all calls to EigenLayer through a single contract. While technically possible, an AVS SHOULD NOT use multiple contracts to interact with EigenLayer. An AVS architecture using multiple contracts to interact with EigenLayer will impose additional burden on stakers in EigenLayer when withdrawing stake.
  
  ## Integration with EigenLayer Contracts:
  In this section, we will explain various API interfaces that EigenLayer provides which are essential for AVSs to integrate with EigenLayer. 
  
  ### *Operators Opting into AVS*
  In order for any EigenLayer operator to be able to opt-in to an AVS, EigenLayer provides two interfaces: `optIntoSlashing(..)` and `recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)`. The sequential flow for opting into an AVS using these functions is as follows:
  1. The operator first opts into slashing by calling  `Slasher.optIntoSlashing(..)`, where it has to specify the address of the AVS's ServiceManager contract in the argument. This step results in the operator giving permission to the AVS's ServiceManager contract to slash the operator via EigenLayer, if the operator is ever proven to have engaged in adversarial behavior while responding to the AVS's task. A successful call to  `Slasher.optIntoSlashing(..)` emits the `OptedIntoSlashing(..)` event.
  2. Next, the operator needs to register with the AVS on chain via an AVS-specific registry contract (see [this][middleware-guide-link] section for examples). To integrate with EigenLayer, the AVS's Registry contract provides a registration endpoint that calls on the AVS's `ServiceManager.recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)` which in turn calls `Slasher.recordFirstStakeUpdate(..)`. On successful execution of this function call, the event `MiddlewareTimesAdded(..)` is emitted and the operator has to start serving the tasks from the AVS.
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow: 
  ![Operator opting-in](../images/operator_opting.png)
  
  ### *Staker Delegation to an Operator: Which Opts-In to AVSs*
  
  A staker does not restake into AVSs. A staker delegates to an operator and it is the operator that registers for new AVSs (with the staker having option to opt-out).
  
  By delegating to a specific operator, stakers are implicitly agreeing to the AVSs they support. If desired, operators can pursue off-chain consensus with stakers prior to modifying their AVSs. Moreover, stakers will have a grace period to withdraw their delegation should an operator introduce an AVS that doesn't align with their objectives. This grace period is configurable on an operator level.
  
  ### *AVS Visibility and Control*
  
  An AVS registration function can blacklist another AVS contract and during registration check that the operator is not registered in that AVS. Or it can check that the operator has not given permission to that AVS's service manager to slash it.
  
  An AVS registry contract should define quorums (eth LST quorum, erc20 quorum, etc.) and allow (or prefer) operators having a minimum amount of restaked assets in each of those quorums to register with the AVS.
  
  ### *Recording Stake Updates*
  EigenLayer is a dynamic system where stakers and operators are constantly adjusting amounts of stake delegated via the system. It is therefore imperative for an AVS to be aware of any changes to stake delegated to its operators. In order to facilitate this, EigenLayer offers the `Slasher.recordStakeUpdate(..)`.
  
  Let us illustrate the usage of this facility with an example: A staker has delegated to an operator, who has opted-in to serving an AVS. Whenever the staker withdraws some or all of its stake from EigenLayer, this withdrawal affects all the AVSs uniformly that the staker's delegated operator is participating in. The series of steps for withdrawing stake is as follows:
   - The staker queues their withdrawal request with EigenLayer. The staker can place this request by calling  `StrategyManager.queueWithdrawal(..)`.
   - The operator, noticing an upcoming change in their delegated stake, notifies the AVS about this change. To do this, the operator triggers the AVS to call the `ServiceManager.recordStakeUpdate(..)` which in turn accesses `Slasher.recordStakeUpdate(..)`.  On successful execution of this call, the event `MiddlewareTimesAdded(..)` is emitted.
  - The AVS provider now is aware of the change in stake, and the staker can eventually complete their withdrawal.  Refer [here](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/master/docs/EigenLayer-withdrawal-flow.md) for more details
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow: 
  ![Stake update](../images/staker_withdrawing.png)
  
  ### *Deregistering from AVS*
  In order for any EigenLayer operator to be able to de-register from an AVS, EigenLayer provides the interface `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility(..)`. Essentially, in order for an operator to deregister from an AVS, the operator has to call `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility(..)`  via the AVS's ServiceManager contract. It is important to note that the latest block number until which the operator is required to serve tasks for the service must be known by the service and included in the ServiceManager's call to `Slasher.recordLastStakeUpdateAndRevokeSlashingAbility`.
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow in which the operator calls the `deregister(..)` function in a sample Registry contract.
  ![Operator deregistering](../images/operator_deregister.png)
  
  ### *Slashing*
  As mentioned above, EigenLayer is built to support slashing as a result of an on-chain-checkable, objectively attributable action. In order for an AVS to be able to slash an operator in an objective manner, the AVS needs to deploy a DisputeResolution contract which anyone can call to raise a challenge against an EigenLayer operator for its adversarial action. On successful challenge, the DisputeResolution contract calls `ServiceManager.freezeOperator(..)`; the ServiceManager in turn calls `Slasher.freezeOperator(..)` to freeze the operator in EigenLayer. EigenLayer's Slasher contract emits a `OperatorFrozen(..)` event whenever an operator is (successfully) frozen
  
  The following figure illustrates the above flow: 
  ![Slashing](../images/slashing.png)
  
  
  ## Quick Start Guide to Build AVS Contracts:
  The EigenLayer team has built a set of reusable and extensible contracts for use in AVSs built on top of EigenLayer. These are contained in the general-purpose [/middleware/ folder][middleware-folder-link], which contains code that can be extended, used directly, or consulted as a reference in building AVS on top of EigenLayer. There are several basic contracts that all AVS-specific contracts can be built on:
  - The *VoteWeigherBase contract* tracks an operator’s “weight” in a given quorum, across all strategies that are associated with that quorum.  This contract also manages which strategies are in each quorum - this includes functionalities for both adding and removing strategies, as well as changing strategy weights.  
  - The *RegistryBase contract* is a basic registry contract that can be used to track operators opted-into running an AVS.  Importantly, this base registry contract assumes a maximum of two quorums, where each quorum represents an aggregation of a certain type of stake. 
  
  Furthermore, it’s expected that many AVSs will require a quorum of registered operators to sign on commitments.  To this end, the EigenLabs team has developed a set of contracts designed to optimize the cost of checking signatures through the use of a BLS aggregate signature scheme:
  ### BLSPublicKeyCompendium
  This contract allows each Ethereum address to register a unique BLS public key; a single BLSPublicKeyCompendium contract can be shared amongst all AVSs using BLS signatures. <br/>
  ### BLSRegistry
  This contract builds upon lower-level (RegistryBase and VoteWeigherBase) contracts, to allow users of EigenLayer to register as operators for a single AVS. Each AVS’s BLSRegistry keeps a historic record of the Aggregate Public Key (APK) of all operators of the AVS. To allow proper encoding of data and aggregation of signatures while avoiding race conditions (e.g. from operators registering or deregistering, causing the current APK to change), each task defines a referenceBlockNumber, which may be briefly in the past. The BLSRegistry defines an optional whitelister role, which controls whether or not the whitelist is enabled and can edit the whitelist. If the whitelist is enabled, then only addresses that have been whitelisted may opt-in to serving the AVS. <br/>   
  
  In addition, the BLSRegistry (technically the lower-level RegistryBase which the BLSRegistry inherits from) defines a “minimum stake” for the quorum(s). An operator can only register for the AVS if they meet the minimum requirement for at least one quorum. By default the `ServiceManager.owner()` has the ability to change the minimum stake requirement(s). Each BLSRegistry defines one or two “quorums”; each operator for the AVS may have stake in EigenLayer that falls into either (or both) quorum(s). Each quorum is essentially defined by two vectors: a vector of “Strategies” of interest (in practice this ends up being tokens of interest) and a vector of “weights” or “multipliers”, which define whether certain strategies are weighed more heavily than others within the quorum (e.g. if the AVS desires to give 2x power to a specific token over another token). In the contract code these vectors are condensed into a single array of `StrategyAndWeightingMultiplier` structs. The `ServiceManager.owner()` has the ability to edit these arrays at will.
  
  ### BLSSignatureChecker
  When signatures have been aggregated, they can be submitted to the BLSSignatureChecker, an optimized contract designed expressly for verifying quorums of BLS signers. The caller MUST provide a small amount of data corresponding to the task to be confirmed, the aggregate signature itself, and a bit of data for each non-signer, that is, the caller MUST provide data for each operator registered for the service for whom their signature has not been aggregated. The BLSSignatureChecker ultimately returns both the total stake that was present at the specified block number (i.e. the sum of all operator’s stakes) and the total stake that signed; these amounts can then be checked against a quorum condition (e.g. requiring ⅔ stake to sign) before the task is ultimately confirmed.

  # Forge Standard Library • [![CI status](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  
  Forge Standard Library is a collection of helpful contracts and libraries for use with [Forge and Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry). It leverages Forge's cheatcodes to make writing tests easier and faster, while improving the UX of cheatcodes.
  
  **Learn how to use Forge-Std with the [📖 Foundry Book (Forge-Std Guide)](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/forge-std.html).**
  
  ## Install
  
  ```bash
  forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
  ```
  
  ## Contracts
  ### stdError
  
  This is a helper contract for errors and reverts. In Forge, this contract is particularly helpful for the `expectRevert` cheatcode, as it provides all compiler builtin errors.
  
  See the contract itself for all error codes.
  
  #### Example usage
  
  ```solidity
  
  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  
  contract TestContract is Test {
      ErrorsTest test;
  
      function setUp() public {
          test = new ErrorsTest();
      }
  
      function testExpectArithmetic() public {
          vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
          test.arithmeticError(10);
      }
  }
  
  contract ErrorsTest {
      function arithmeticError(uint256 a) public {
          uint256 a = a - 100;
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ### stdStorage
  
  This is a rather large contract due to all of the overloading to make the UX decent. Primarily, it is a wrapper around the `record` and `accesses` cheatcodes. It can *always* find and write the storage slot(s) associated with a particular variable without knowing the storage layout. The one _major_ caveat to this is while a slot can be found for packed storage variables, we can't write to that variable safely. If a user tries to write to a packed slot, the execution throws an error, unless it is uninitialized (`bytes32(0)`).
  
  This works by recording all `SLOAD`s and `SSTORE`s during a function call. If there is a single slot read or written to, it immediately returns the slot. Otherwise, behind the scenes, we iterate through and check each one (assuming the user passed in a `depth` parameter). If the variable is a struct, you can pass in a `depth` parameter which is basically the field depth.
  
  I.e.:
  ```solidity
  struct T {
      // depth 0
      uint256 a;
      // depth 1
      uint256 b;
  }
  ```
  
  #### Example usage
  
  ```solidity
  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  
  contract TestContract is Test {
      using stdStorage for StdStorage;
  
      Storage test;
  
      function setUp() public {
          test = new Storage();
      }
  
      function testFindExists() public {
          // Lets say we want to find the slot for the public
          // variable `exists`. We just pass in the function selector
          // to the `find` command
          uint256 slot = stdstore.target(address(test)).sig("exists()").find();
          assertEq(slot, 0);
      }
  
      function testWriteExists() public {
          // Lets say we want to write to the slot for the public
          // variable `exists`. We just pass in the function selector
          // to the `checked_write` command
          stdstore.target(address(test)).sig("exists()").checked_write(100);
          assertEq(test.exists(), 100);
      }
  
      // It supports arbitrary storage layouts, like assembly based storage locations
      function testFindHidden() public {
          // `hidden` is a random hash of a bytes, iteration through slots would
          // not find it. Our mechanism does
          // Also, you can use the selector instead of a string
          uint256 slot = stdstore.target(address(test)).sig(test.hidden.selector).find();
          assertEq(slot, uint256(keccak256("my.random.var")));
      }
  
      // If targeting a mapping, you have to pass in the keys necessary to perform the find
      // i.e.:
      function testFindMapping() public {
          uint256 slot = stdstore
              .target(address(test))
              .sig(test.map_addr.selector)
              .with_key(address(this))
              .find();
          // in the `Storage` constructor, we wrote that this address' value was 1 in the map
          // so when we load the slot, we expect it to be 1
          assertEq(uint(vm.load(address(test), bytes32(slot))), 1);
      }
  
      // If the target is a struct, you can specify the field depth:
      function testFindStruct() public {
          // NOTE: see the depth parameter - 0 means 0th field, 1 means 1st field, etc.
          uint256 slot_for_a_field = stdstore
              .target(address(test))
              .sig(test.basicStruct.selector)
              .depth(0)
              .find();
  
          uint256 slot_for_b_field = stdstore
              .target(address(test))
              .sig(test.basicStruct.selector)
              .depth(1)
              .find();
  
          assertEq(uint(vm.load(address(test), bytes32(slot_for_a_field))), 1);
          assertEq(uint(vm.load(address(test), bytes32(slot_for_b_field))), 2);
      }
  }
  
  // A complex storage contract
  contract Storage {
      struct UnpackedStruct {
          uint256 a;
          uint256 b;
      }
  
      constructor() {
          map_addr[msg.sender] = 1;
      }
  
      uint256 public exists = 1;
      mapping(address => uint256) public map_addr;
      // mapping(address => Packed) public map_packed;
      mapping(address => UnpackedStruct) public map_struct;
      mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public deep_map;
      mapping(address => mapping(address => UnpackedStruct)) public deep_map_struct;
      UnpackedStruct public basicStruct = UnpackedStruct({
          a: 1,
          b: 2
      });
  
      function hidden() public view returns (bytes32 t) {
          // an extremely hidden storage slot
          bytes32 slot = keccak256("my.random.var");
          assembly {
              t := sload(slot)
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ### stdCheats
  
  This is a wrapper over miscellaneous cheatcodes that need wrappers to be more dev friendly. Currently there are only functions related to `prank`. In general, users may expect ETH to be put into an address on `prank`, but this is not the case for safety reasons. Explicitly this `hoax` function should only be used for address that have expected balances as it will get overwritten. If an address already has ETH, you should just use `prank`. If you want to change that balance explicitly, just use `deal`. If you want to do both, `hoax` is also right for you.
  
  
  #### Example usage:
  ```solidity
  
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
  
  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  
  // Inherit the stdCheats
  contract StdCheatsTest is Test {
      Bar test;
      function setUp() public {
          test = new Bar();
      }
  
      function testHoax() public {
          // we call `hoax`, which gives the target address
          // eth and then calls `prank`
          hoax(address(1337));
          test.bar{value: 100}(address(1337));
  
          // overloaded to allow you to specify how much eth to
          // initialize the address with
          hoax(address(1337), 1);
          test.bar{value: 1}(address(1337));
      }
  
      function testStartHoax() public {
          // we call `startHoax`, which gives the target address
          // eth and then calls `startPrank`
          //
          // it is also overloaded so that you can specify an eth amount
          startHoax(address(1337));
          test.bar{value: 100}(address(1337));
          test.bar{value: 100}(address(1337));
          vm.stopPrank();
          test.bar(address(this));
      }
  }
  
  contract Bar {
      function bar(address expectedSender) public payable {
          require(msg.sender == expectedSender, "!prank");
      }
  }
  ```
  
  ### Std Assertions
  
  Expand upon the assertion functions from the `DSTest` library.
  
  ### `console.log`
  
  Usage follows the same format as [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/reference/#console-log).
  It's recommended to use `console2.sol` as shown below, as this will show the decoded logs in Forge traces.
  
  ```solidity
  // import it indirectly via Test.sol
  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  // or directly import it
  import "forge-std/console2.sol";
  ...
  console2.log(someValue);
  ```
  
  If you need compatibility with Hardhat, you must use the standard `console.sol` instead.
  Due to a bug in `console.sol`, logs that use `uint256` or `int256` types will not be properly decoded in Forge traces.
  
  ```solidity
  // import it indirectly via Test.sol
  import "forge-std/Test.sol";
  // or directly import it
  import "forge-std/console.sol";
  ...
  console.log(someValue);
  ```

   * `SafeERC20`: add `safePermit` as mitigation against phantom permit functions. ([#3280](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3280))
   * `Math`: add a `mulDiv` function that can round the result either up or down. ([#3171](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3171))
   * `Math`: Add a `sqrt` function to compute square roots of integers, rounding either up or down. ([#3242](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3242))
   * `Strings`: add a new overloaded function `toHexString` that converts an `address` with fixed length of 20 bytes to its not checksummed ASCII `string` hexadecimal representation. ([#3403](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3403))
   * `EnumerableMap`: add new `UintToUintMap` map type. ([#3338](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3338))
   * `EnumerableMap`: add new `Bytes32ToUintMap` map type. ([#3416](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3416))
   * `SafeCast`: add support for many more types, using procedural code generation. ([#3245](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3245))
   * `MerkleProof`: add `multiProofVerify` to prove multiple values are part of a Merkle tree. ([#3276](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3276))
   * `MerkleProof`: add calldata versions of the functions to avoid copying input arrays to memory and save gas. ([#3200](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3200))
   * `ERC721`, `ERC1155`: simplified revert reasons. ([#3254](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3254), ([#3438](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3438)))
   * `ERC721`: removed redundant require statement. ([#3434](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3434))
   * `PaymentSplitter`: add `releasable` getters. ([#3350](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3350))
   * `Initializable`: refactored implementation of modifiers for easier understanding. ([#3450](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3450))
   * `Proxies`: remove runtime check of ERC1967 storage slots. ([#3455](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3455))
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
   * `Initializable`: functions decorated with the modifier `reinitializer(1)` may no longer invoke each other.
  
  ## 4.6.0 (2022-04-26)
  
   * `crosschain`: Add a new set of contracts for cross-chain applications. `CrossChainEnabled` is a base contract with instantiations for several chains and bridges, and `AccessControlCrossChain` is an extension of access control that allows cross-chain operation. ([#3183](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3183))
   * `AccessControl`: add a virtual `_checkRole(bytes32)` function that can be overridden to alter the `onlyRole` modifier behavior. ([#3137](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3137))
   * `EnumerableMap`: add new `AddressToUintMap` map type. ([#3150](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3150))
   * `EnumerableMap`: add new `Bytes32ToBytes32Map` map type. ([#3192](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3192))
   * `ERC20FlashMint`: support infinite allowance when paying back a flash loan. ([#3226](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3226))
   * `ERC20Wrapper`: the `decimals()` function now tries to fetch the value from the underlying token instance. If that calls revert, then the default value is used. ([#3259](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3259))
   * `draft-ERC20Permit`: replace `immutable` with `constant` for `_PERMIT_TYPEHASH` since the `keccak256` of string literals is treated specially and the hash is evaluated at compile time. ([#3196](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3196))
   * `ERC1155`: Add a `_afterTokenTransfer` hook for improved extensibility. ([#3166](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3166))
   * `ERC1155URIStorage`: add a new extension that implements a `_setURI` behavior similar to ERC721's `_setTokenURI`. ([#3210](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3210))
   * `DoubleEndedQueue`: a new data structure that supports efficient push and pop to both front and back, useful for FIFO and LIFO queues. ([#3153](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3153))
   * `Governor`: improved security of `onlyGovernance` modifier when using an external executor contract (e.g. a timelock) that can operate without necessarily going through the governance protocol. ([#3147](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3147))
   * `Governor`: Add a way to parameterize votes. This can be used to implement voting systems such as fractionalized voting, ERC721 based voting, or any number of other systems. The `params` argument added to `_countVote` method, and included in the newly added `_getVotes` method, can be used by counting and voting modules respectively for such purposes. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
   * `Governor`: rewording of revert reason for consistency. ([#3275](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3275))
   * `Governor`: fix an inconsistency in data locations that could lead to invalid bytecode being produced. ([#3295](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3295))
   * `Governor`: Implement `IERC721Receiver` and `IERC1155Receiver` to improve token custody by governors. ([#3230](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3230))
   * `TimelockController`: Implement `IERC721Receiver` and `IERC1155Receiver` to improve token custody by timelocks. ([#3230](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3230))
   * `TimelockController`: Add a separate canceller role for the ability to cancel. ([#3165](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3165))
   * `Initializable`: add a reinitializer modifier that enables the initialization of new modules, added to already initialized contracts through upgradeability. ([#3232](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3232))
   * `Initializable`: add an Initialized event that tracks initialized version numbers. ([#3294](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3294))
   * `ERC2981`: make `royaltyInfo` public to allow super call in overrides. ([#3305](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3305))
  
  ### Upgradeability notice
  
  * `TimelockController`: **(Action needed)** The upgrade from <4.6 to >=4.6 introduces a new `CANCELLER_ROLE` that requires set up to be assignable. After the upgrade, only addresses with this role will have the ability to cancel. Proposers will no longer be able to cancel. Assigning cancellers can be done by an admin (including the timelock itself) once the role admin is set up. To do this, we recommend upgrading to the `TimelockControllerWith46MigrationUpgradeable` contract and then calling the `migrateTo46` function.
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
  * `Governor`: Adds internal virtual `_getVotes` method that must be implemented; this is a breaking change for existing concrete extensions to `Governor`. To fix this on an existing voting module extension, rename `getVotes` to `_getVotes` and add a `bytes memory` argument. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
  * `Governor`: Adds `params` parameter to internal virtual `_countVote ` method; this is a breaking change for existing concrete extensions to `Governor`. To fix this on an existing counting module extension, add a `bytes memory` argument to `_countVote`. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
  * `Governor`: Does not emit `VoteCast` event when params data is non-empty; instead emits `VoteCastWithParams` event. To fix this on an integration that consumes the `VoteCast` event, also fetch/monitor `VoteCastWithParams` events. ([#3043](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3043))
  * `Votes`: The internal virtual function `_getVotingUnits` was made `view` (which was accidentally missing). Any overrides should now be updated so they are `view` as well.
  
  ## 4.5.0 (2022-02-09)
  
   * `ERC2981`: add implementation of the royalty standard, and the respective extensions for `ERC721` and `ERC1155`. ([#3012](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3012))
   * `GovernorTimelockControl`: improve the `state()` function to have it reflect cases where a proposal has been canceled directly on the timelock. ([#2977](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2977))
   * Preset contracts are now deprecated in favor of [Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com). ([#2986](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2986))
   * `Governor`: add a relay function to help recover assets sent to a governor that is not its own executor (e.g. when using a timelock). ([#2926](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2926))
   * `GovernorPreventLateQuorum`: add new module to ensure a minimum voting duration is available after the quorum is reached. ([#2973](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2973))
   * `ERC721`: improved revert reason when transferring from wrong owner. ([#2975](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2975))
   * `Votes`: Added a base contract for vote tracking with delegation. ([#2944](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2944))
   * `ERC721Votes`: Added an extension of ERC721 enabled with vote tracking and delegation. ([#2944](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2944))
   * `ERC2771Context`: use immutable storage to store the forwarder address, no longer an issue since Solidity >=0.8.8 allows reading immutable variables in the constructor. ([#2917](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2917))
   * `Base64`: add a library to parse bytes into base64 strings using `encode(bytes memory)` function, and provide examples to show how to use to build URL-safe `tokenURIs`. ([#2884](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2884))
   * `ERC20`: reduce allowance before triggering transfer. ([#3056](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3056))
   * `ERC20`: do not update allowance on `transferFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3085](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3085))
   * `ERC20`: add a `_spendAllowance` internal function. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
   * `ERC20Burnable`: do not update allowance on `burnFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
   * `ERC777`: do not update allowance on `transferFrom` when allowance is `type(uint256).max`. ([#3085](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3085))
   * `ERC777`: add a `_spendAllowance` internal function. ([#3170](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3170))
   * `SignedMath`: a new signed version of the Math library with `max`, `min`,  and `average`. ([#2686](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2686))
   * `SignedMath`: add a `abs(int256)` method that returns the unsigned absolute value of a signed value. ([#2984](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2984))
   * `ERC1967Upgrade`: Refactor the secure upgrade to use `ERC1822` instead of the previous rollback mechanism. This reduces code complexity and attack surface with similar security guarantees. ([#3021](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3021))
   * `UUPSUpgradeable`: Add `ERC1822` compliance to support the updated secure upgrade mechanism. ([#3021](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3021))
   * Some more functions have been made virtual to customize them via overrides. In many cases this will not imply that other functions in the contract will automatically adapt to the overridden definitions. People who wish to override should consult the source code to understand the impact and if they need to override any additional functions to achieve the desired behavior.
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
  * `ERC1967Upgrade`: The function `_upgradeToAndCallSecure` was renamed to `_upgradeToAndCallUUPS`, along with the change in security mechanism described above.
  * `Address`: The Solidity pragma is increased from `^0.8.0` to `^0.8.1`. This is required by the `account.code.length` syntax that replaces inline assembly. This may require users to bump their compiler version from `0.8.0` to `0.8.1` or later. Note that other parts of the code already include stricter requirements.
  
  ## 4.4.2 (2022-01-11)
  
  ### Bugfixes
   * `GovernorCompatibilityBravo`: Fix error in the encoding of calldata for proposals submitted through the compatibility interface with explicit signatures. ([#3100](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3100))
  
  ## 4.4.1 (2021-12-14)
  
   * `Initializable`: change the existing `initializer` modifier and add a new `onlyInitializing` modifier to prevent reentrancy risk. ([#3006](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3006))
  
  ### Breaking change
  
  It is no longer possible to call an `initializer`-protected function from within another `initializer` function outside the context of a constructor. Projects using OpenZeppelin upgradeable proxies should continue to work as is, since in the common case the initializer is invoked in the constructor directly. If this is not the case for you, the suggested change is to use the new `onlyInitializing` modifier in the following way:
  
  ```diff
   contract A {
  -    function initialize() public   initializer { ... }
  +    function initialize() internal onlyInitializing { ... }
   }
   contract B is A {
       function initialize() public initializer {
           A.initialize();
       }
   }
  ```

   * `BitMaps`: add a new `BitMaps` library that provides a storage efficient datastructure for `uint256` to `bool` mapping with contiguous keys. ([#2710](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2710))
  
  ### Breaking Changes
  
   * `ERC20FlashMint` is no longer a Draft ERC. ([#2673](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2673)))
  
  **How to update:** Change your import paths by removing the `draft-` prefix from `@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/draft-ERC20FlashMint.sol`.
  
  > See [Releases and Stability: Drafts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/releases-stability#drafts).
  
  ## 4.1.0 (2021-04-29)
  
   * `IERC20Metadata`: add a new extended interface that includes the optional `name()`, `symbol()` and `decimals()` functions. ([#2561](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2561))

  ### Breaking changes
  
  This release includes two small breaking changes in `TimelockController`.
  
  1. The `onlyRole` modifier in this contract was designed to let anyone through if the role was granted to `address(0)`,
     allowing the possibility to to make a role "open", which can be used for `EXECUTOR_ROLE`. This modifier is now
     replaced by `AccessControl.onlyRole`, which does not have this ability. The previous behavior was moved to the
     modifier `TimelockController.onlyRoleOrOpenRole`.
  2. It was possible to make `PROPOSER_ROLE` an open role (as described in the previous item) if it was granted to
     `address(0)`. This would affect the `schedule`, `scheduleBatch`, and `cancel` operations in `TimelockController`.
     This ability was removed as it does not make sense to open up the `PROPOSER_ROLE` in the same way that it does for
     `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
  
  ## 4.0.0 (2021-03-23)
  
   * Now targeting the 0.8.x line of Solidity compilers. For 0.6.x (resp 0.7.x) support, use version 3.4.0 (resp 3.4.0-solc-0.7) of OpenZeppelin.
   * `Context`: making `_msgData` return `bytes calldata` instead of `bytes memory` ([#2492](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2492))
   * `ERC20`: removed the `_setDecimals` function and the storage slot associated to decimals. ([#2502](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2502))
   * `Strings`: addition of a `toHexString` function.  ([#2504](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2504))
   * `EnumerableMap`: change implementation to optimize for `key → value` lookups instead of enumeration. ([#2518](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2518))
   * `GSN`: deprecate GSNv1 support in favor of upcoming support for GSNv2. ([#2521](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2521))
   * `ERC165`: remove uses of storage in the base ERC165 implementation. ERC165 based contracts now use storage-less virtual functions. Old behavior remains available in the `ERC165Storage` extension. ([#2505](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2505))
   * `Initializable`: make initializer check stricter during construction. ([#2531](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2531))
   * `ERC721`: remove enumerability of tokens from the base implementation. This feature is now provided separately through the `ERC721Enumerable` extension. ([#2511](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2511))
   * `AccessControl`: removed enumerability by default for a more lightweight contract. It is now opt-in through `AccessControlEnumerable`. ([#2512](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2512))
   * Meta Transactions: add `ERC2771Context` and a `MinimalForwarder` for meta-transactions. ([#2508](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2508))
   * Overall reorganization of the contract folder to improve clarity and discoverability. ([#2503](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2503))
   * `ERC20Capped`: optimize gas usage by enforcing the check directly in `_mint`. ([#2524](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2524))
   * Rename `UpgradeableProxy` to `ERC1967Proxy`. ([#2547](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2547))
   * `ERC777`: optimize the gas costs of the constructor. ([#2551](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2551))
   * `ERC721URIStorage`: add a new extension that implements the `_setTokenURI` behavior as it was available in 3.4.0. ([#2555](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2555))
   * `AccessControl`: added ERC165 interface detection. ([#2562](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2562))
   * `ERC1155`: make `uri` public so overloading function can call it using super. ([#2576](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2576))
  
  ### Bug fixes for beta releases
  
   * `AccessControlEnumerable`: Fixed `renounceRole` not updating enumerable set of addresses for a role. ([#2572](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2572))
  
  ### How to upgrade from 3.x
  
  Since this version has moved a few contracts to different directories, users upgrading from a previous version will need to adjust their import statements. To make this easier, the package includes a script that will migrate import statements automatically. After upgrading to the latest version of the package, run:
  
  ```
  npx openzeppelin-contracts-migrate-imports
  ```
  
  Make sure you're using git or another version control system to be able to recover from any potential error in our script.
  
  ### How to upgrade from 4.0-beta.x
  
  Some further changes have been done between the different beta iterations. Transitions made during this period are configured in the `migrate-imports` script. Consequently, you can upgrade from any previous 4.0-beta.x version using the same script as described in the *How to upgrade from 3.x* section.
  
  ## 3.4.2
  
   * `TimelockController`: Add additional isOperationReady check.
  
  ## 3.4.1 (2021-03-03)
  
   * `ERC721`: made `_approve` an internal function (was private).
  
  ## 3.4.0 (2021-02-02)
  
   * `BeaconProxy`: added new kind of proxy that allows simultaneous atomic upgrades. ([#2411](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2411))
   * `EIP712`: added helpers to verify EIP712 typed data signatures on chain. ([#2418](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2418))
   * `ERC20Permit`: added an implementation of the ERC20 permit extension for gasless token approvals. ([#2237](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2237))

   * `Clones`: added a library for deploying EIP 1167 minimal proxies. ([#2449](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2449))
   * `Context`: moved from `contracts/GSN` to `contracts/utils`. ([#2453](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2453))
   * `PaymentSplitter`: replace usage of `.transfer()` with `Address.sendValue` for improved compatibility with smart wallets. ([#2455](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2455))
   * `UpgradeableProxy`: bubble revert reasons from initialization calls. ([#2454](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2454))
   * `SafeMath`: fix a memory allocation issue by adding new `SafeMath.tryOp(uint,uint)→(bool,uint)` functions. `SafeMath.op(uint,uint,string)→uint` are now deprecated. ([#2462](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2462))
   * `EnumerableMap`: fix a memory allocation issue by adding new `EnumerableMap.tryGet(uint)→(bool,address)` functions. `EnumerableMap.get(uint)→string` is now deprecated. ([#2462](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2462))
   * `ERC165Checker`: added batch `getSupportedInterfaces`. ([#2469](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2469))
   * `RefundEscrow`: `beneficiaryWithdraw` will forward all available gas to the beneficiary. ([#2480](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2480))
   * Many view and pure functions have been made virtual to customize them via overrides. In many cases this will not imply that other functions in the contract will automatically adapt to the overridden definitions. People who wish to override should consult the source code to understand the impact and if they need to override any additional functions to achieve the desired behavior.
  
  ### Security Fixes
  
   * `ERC777`: fix potential reentrancy issues for custom extensions to `ERC777`. ([#2483](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2483))
  
  If you're using our implementation of ERC777 from version 3.3.0 or earlier, and you define a custom `_beforeTokenTransfer` function that writes to a storage variable, you may be vulnerable to a reentrancy attack. If you're affected and would like assistance please write to security@openzeppelin.com. [Read more in the pull request.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2483)
  
  ## 3.3.0 (2020-11-26)
  
   * Now supports both Solidity 0.6 and 0.7. Compiling with solc 0.7 will result in warnings. Install the `solc-0.7` tag to compile without warnings.
   * `Address`: added `functionStaticCall`, similar to the existing `functionCall`. ([#2333](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2333))

   * First release of Upgradeable variant, replacing Ethereum Package variant which is now deprecated.
  
  ## 3.2.2-solc-0.7 (2020-10-28)
   * Resolve warnings introduced by Solidity 0.7.4. ([#2396](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2396))
  
  ## 3.2.1-solc-0.7 (2020-09-15)
   * `ERC777`: Remove a warning about function state visibility in Solidity 0.7. ([#2327](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2327))
  
  ## 3.2.0 (2020-09-10)
  
  ### New features
   * Proxies: added the proxy contracts from OpenZeppelin SDK. ([#2335](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2335))
  
  #### Proxy changes with respect to OpenZeppelin SDK
  
  Aside from upgrading them from Solidity 0.5 to 0.6, we've changed a few minor things from the proxy contracts as they were found in OpenZeppelin SDK.
  
  - `UpgradeabilityProxy` was renamed to `UpgradeableProxy`.
  - `AdminUpgradeabilityProxy` was renamed to `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`.
  - `Proxy._willFallback` was renamed to `Proxy._beforeFallback`.
  - `UpgradeabilityProxy._setImplementation` and `AdminUpgradeabilityProxy._setAdmin` were made private.
  
  ### Improvements
   * `Address.isContract`: switched from `extcodehash` to `extcodesize` for less gas usage. ([#2311](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2311))
  
  ### Breaking changes
   * `ERC20Snapshot`: switched to using `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook instead of overriding ERC20 operations. ([#2312](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2312))
  
  This small change in the way we implemented `ERC20Snapshot` may affect users who are combining this contract with
  other ERC20 flavors, since it no longer overrides `_transfer`, `_mint`, and `_burn`. This can result in having to remove Solidity `override(...)` specifiers in derived contracts for these functions, and to instead have to add it for `_beforeTokenTransfer`. See [Using Hooks](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/extending-contracts#using-hooks) in the documentation.
  
  ## 3.1.0 (2020-06-23)
  
  ### New features

   * `functionCall`: new helpers that replicate Solidity's function call semantics, reducing the need to rely on `call`. ([#2264](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2264))
   * `ERC1155`: added support for a base implementation, non-standard extensions and a preset contract. ([#2014](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2014), [#2230](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2230))
  
  ### Improvements
   * `ReentrancyGuard`: reduced overhead of using the `nonReentrant` modifier. ([#2171](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2171))
   * `AccessControl`: added a `RoleAdminChanged` event to `_setAdminRole`. ([#2214](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2214))
   * Made all `public` functions in the token preset contracts `virtual`. ([#2257](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2257))
  
  ### Deprecations
   * `SafeERC20`: deprecated `safeApprove`. ([#2268](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2268))
  
  ## 3.0.2 (2020-06-08)
  
  ### Improvements
   * Added SPX license identifier to all contracts. ([#2235](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2235))
  
  ## 3.0.1 (2020-04-27)
  
  ### Bugfixes
   * `ERC777`: fixed the `_approve` internal function not validating some of their arguments for non-zero addresses. ([#2213](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2213))
  
  ## 3.0.0 (2020-04-20)
  
  ### New features
   * `AccessControl`: new contract for managing permissions in a system, replacement for `Ownable` and `Roles`. ([#2112](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2112))

   * `EnumerableMap`: a new data structure for key-value pairs (like `mapping`) that can be iterated over. ([#2160](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2160))
  
  ### Breaking changes
   * `ERC721`: `burn(owner, tokenId)` was removed, use `burn(tokenId)` instead. ([#2125](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2125))
   * `ERC721`: `_checkOnERC721Received` was removed. ([#2125](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2125))

   * `Ownable`: removed `_transferOwnership`. ([#2162](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2162))
   * `PullPayment`, `Escrow`: `withdrawWithGas` was removed. The old `withdraw` function now forwards all gas. ([#2125](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2125))
   * `Roles` was removed, use `AccessControl` as a replacement. ([#2112](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2112))
   * `ECDSA`: when receiving an invalid signature, `recover` now reverts instead of returning the zero address. ([#2114](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2114))
   * `Create2`: added an `amount` argument to `deploy` for contracts with `payable` constructors. ([#2117](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2117))
   * `Pausable`: moved to the `utils` directory. ([#2122](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2122))
   * `Strings`: moved to the `utils` directory. ([#2122](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2122))
   * `Counters`: moved to the `utils` directory. ([#2122](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2122))

   * `Ownable`: moved to the `access` directory. ([#2120](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2120))
   * `Ownable`: removed `isOwner`. ([#2120](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2120))
   * `Secondary`: removed from the library, use `Ownable` instead. ([#2120](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2120))
   * `Escrow`, `ConditionalEscrow`, `RefundEscrow`: these now use `Ownable` instead of `Secondary`, their external API changed accordingly. ([#2120](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2120))
   * `ERC20`: removed `_burnFrom`. ([#2119](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2119))
   * `Address`: removed `toPayable`, use `payable(address)` instead. ([#2133](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2133))
   * `ERC777`: `_send`, `_mint` and `_burn` now use the caller as the operator. ([#2134](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2134))
   * `ERC777`: removed `_callsTokensToSend` and `_callTokensReceived`. ([#2134](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2134))
   * `EnumerableSet`: renamed `get` to `at`. ([#2151](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2151))
   * `ERC165Checker`: functions no longer have a leading underscore. ([#2150](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2150))
   * `ERC721Metadata`, `ERC721Enumerable`: these contracts were removed, and their functionality merged into `ERC721`. ([#2160](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2160))
   * `ERC721`: added a constructor for `name` and `symbol`. ([#2160](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2160))
   * `ERC20Detailed`: this contract was removed and its functionality merged into `ERC20`. ([#2161](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2161))
   * `ERC20`: added a constructor for `name` and `symbol`. `decimals` now defaults to 18. ([#2161](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2161))
   * `Strings`: renamed `fromUint256` to `toString` ([#2188](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2188))
  
  ## 2.5.1 (2020-04-24)
  
  ### Bugfixes
   * `ERC777`: fixed the `_send` and `_approve` internal functions not validating some of their arguments for non-zero addresses. ([#2212](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2212))
  
  ## 2.5.0 (2020-02-04)
  
  ### New features
   * `SafeCast.toUintXX`: new library for integer downcasting, which allows for safe operation on smaller types (e.g. `uint32`) when combined with `SafeMath`. ([#1926](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1926))
   * `ERC721Metadata`: added `baseURI`, which can be used for dramatic gas savings when all token URIs share a prefix (e.g. `http://api.myapp.com/tokens/<id>`). ([#1970](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1970))
   * `EnumerableSet`: new library for storing enumerable sets of values. Only `AddressSet` is supported in this release. ([#2061](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/2061))
   * `Create2`: simple library to make usage of the `CREATE2` opcode easier. ([#1744](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1744))
  
  ### Improvements
   * `ERC777`: `_burn` is now internal, providing more flexibility and making it easier to create tokens that deflate. ([#1908](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1908))
   * `ReentrancyGuard`: greatly improved gas efficiency by using the net gas metering mechanism introduced in the Istanbul hardfork. ([#1992](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1992), [#1996](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1996))
   * `ERC777`: improve extensibility by making `_send` and related functions `internal`. ([#2027](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2027))
   * `ERC721`: improved revert reason when transferring tokens to a non-recipient contract. ([#2018](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2018))
  
  ### Breaking changes
   * `ERC165Checker` now requires a minimum Solidity compiler version of 0.5.10. ([#1829](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1829))
  
  ## 2.4.0 (2019-10-29)
  
  ### New features
   * `Address.toPayable`: added a helper to convert between address types without having to resort to low-level casting. ([#1773](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1773))
   * Facilities to make metatransaction-enabled contracts through the Gas Station Network. ([#1844](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1844))
   * `Address.sendValue`: added a replacement to Solidity's `transfer`, removing the fixed gas stipend. ([#1962](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1962))
   * Added replacement for functions that don't forward all gas (which have been deprecated): ([#1976](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1976))
     * `PullPayment.withdrawPaymentsWithGas(address payable payee)`
     * `Escrow.withdrawWithGas(address payable payee)`
   * `SafeMath`: added support for custom error messages to `sub`, `div` and `mod` functions. ([#1828](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1828))
  
  ### Improvements
   * `Address.isContract`: switched from `extcodesize` to `extcodehash` for less gas usage. ([#1802](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1802))
   * `ERC20` and `ERC777` updated to throw custom errors on subtraction overflows. ([#1828](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1828))
  
  ### Deprecations
   * Deprecated functions that don't forward all gas: ([#1976](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1976))
     * `PullPayment.withdrawPayments(address payable payee)`
     * `Escrow.withdraw(address payable payee)`
  
  ### Breaking changes
   * `Address` now requires a minimum Solidity compiler version of 0.5.5. ([#1802](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1802))
   * `SignatureBouncer` has been removed from drafts, both to avoid confusions with the GSN and `GSNRecipientSignature` (previously called `GSNBouncerSignature`) and because the API was not very clear. ([#1879](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/1879))
  
  ### How to upgrade from 2.4.0-beta
  
  The final 2.4.0 release includes a refactor of the GSN contracts that will be a breaking change for 2.4.0-beta users.
  
   * The default empty implementations of `_preRelayedCall` and `_postRelayedCall` were removed and must now be explicitly implemented always in custom recipients. If your custom recipient didn't include an implementation, you can provide an empty one.
   * `GSNRecipient`, `GSNBouncerBase`, and `GSNContext` were all merged into `GSNRecipient`.
   * `GSNBouncerSignature` and `GSNBouncerERC20Fee` were renamed to `GSNRecipientSignature` and `GSNRecipientERC20Fee`.
   * It is no longer necessary to inherit from `GSNRecipient` when using `GSNRecipientSignature` and `GSNRecipientERC20Fee`.
  
  For example, a contract using `GSNBouncerSignature` would have to be changed in the following way.
  
  ```diff
  -contract MyDapp is GSNRecipient, GSNBouncerSignature {
  +contract MyDapp is GSNRecipientSignature {
  ```
  
  Refer to the table below to adjust your inheritance list.
  
  | 2.4.0-beta                         | 2.4.0                        |
  | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
  | `GSNRecipient, GSNBouncerSignature`| `GSNRecipientSignature`      |
  | `GSNRecipient, GSNBouncerERC20Fee` | `GSNRecipientERC20Fee`       |
  | `GSNBouncerBase`                   | `GSNRecipient`               |
  
  ## 2.3.0 (2019-05-27)
  
  ### New features
   * `ERC1820`: added support for interacting with the [ERC1820](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820) registry contract (`IERC1820Registry`), as well as base contracts that can be registered as implementers there. ([#1677](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1677))
   * `ERC777`: support for the [ERC777 token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-777), which has multiple improvements over `ERC20` (but is backwards compatible with it) such as built-in burning, a more  straightforward permission system, and optional sender and receiver hooks on transfer (mandatory for contracts!). ([#1684](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1684))
   * All contracts now have revert reason strings, which give insight into error conditions, and help debug failing transactions. ([#1704](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1704))
  
  ### Improvements
   * Reverted the Solidity version bump done in v2.2.0, setting the minimum compiler version to v0.5.0, to prevent unexpected build breakage. Users are encouraged however to stay on top of new compiler releases, which usually include bugfixes. ([#1729](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1729))
  
  ### Bugfixes
   * `PostDeliveryCrowdsale`: some validations where skipped when paired with other crowdsale flavors, such as `AllowanceCrowdsale`, or `MintableCrowdsale` and `ERC20Capped`, which could cause buyers to not be able to claim their purchased tokens. ([#1721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1721))
   * `ERC20._transfer`: the `from` argument was allowed to be the zero address, so it was possible to internally trigger a transfer of 0 tokens from the zero address. This address is not a valid destinatary of transfers, nor can it give or receive allowance, so this behavior was inconsistent. It now reverts. ([#1752](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1752))
  
  ## 2.2.0 (2019-03-14)
  
  ### New features
   * `ERC20Snapshot`: create snapshots on demand of the token balances and total supply, to later retrieve and e.g. calculate dividends at a past time. ([#1617](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1617))
   * `SafeERC20`: `ERC20` contracts with no return value (i.e. that revert on failure) are now supported. ([#1655](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1655))
   * `ERC20`: added internal `_approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)`, allowing derived contracts to set the allowance of arbitrary accounts. ([#1609](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1609))
   * `ERC20Metadata`: added internal `_setTokenURI(string memory tokenURI)`. ([#1618](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1618))
   * `TimedCrowdsale`: added internal `_extendTime(uint256 newClosingTime)` as well as `TimedCrowdsaleExtended(uint256 prevClosingTime, uint256 newClosingTime)` event allowing to extend the crowdsale, as long as it hasn't already closed.
  
  ### Improvements
   * Upgraded the minimum compiler version to v0.5.2: this removes many Solidity warnings that were false positives. ([#1606](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1606))
   * `ECDSA`: `recover` no longer accepts malleable signatures (those using upper-range values for `s`, or 0/1 for `v`). ([#1622](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1622))
   * ``ERC721``'s transfers are now more gas efficient due to removal of unnecessary `SafeMath` calls. ([#1610](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1610))
   * Fixed variable shadowing issues. ([#1606](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1606))
  
  ### Bugfixes
   * (minor) `SafeERC20`: `safeApprove` wasn't properly checking for a zero allowance when attempting to set a non-zero allowance. ([#1647](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1647))
  
  ### Breaking changes in drafts
   * `TokenMetadata` has been renamed to `ERC20Metadata`. ([#1618](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1618))
   * The library `Counter` has been renamed to `Counters` and its API has been improved. See an example in `ERC721`, lines [17](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/3cb4a00fce1da76196ac0ac3a0ae9702b99642b5/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L17) and [204](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/3cb4a00fce1da76196ac0ac3a0ae9702b99642b5/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L204). ([#1610](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1610))
  
  ## 2.1.3 (2019-02-26)
   * Backported `SafeERC20.safeApprove` bugfix. ([#1647](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1647))
  
  ## 2.1.2 (2019-01-17)
   * Removed most of the test suite from the npm package, except `PublicRole.behavior.js`, which may be useful to users testing their own `Roles`.
  
  ## 2.1.1 (2019-01-04)
   * Version bump to avoid conflict in the npm registry.
  
  ## 2.1.0 (2019-01-04)
  
  ### New features
   * Now targeting the 0.5.x line of Solidity compilers. For 0.4.24 support, use version 2.0 of OpenZeppelin.
   * `WhitelistCrowdsale`: a crowdsale where only whitelisted accounts (`WhitelistedRole`) can purchase tokens. Adding or removing accounts from the whitelist is done by whitelist admins (`WhitelistAdminRole`). Similar to the pre-2.0 `WhitelistedCrowdsale`. ([#1525](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1525), [#1589](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1589))
   * `RefundablePostDeliveryCrowdsale`: replacement for `RefundableCrowdsale` (deprecated, see below) where tokens are only granted once the crowdsale ends (if it meets its goal). ([#1543](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1543))
   * `PausableCrowdsale`: allows for pausers (`PauserRole`) to pause token purchases. Other crowdsale operations (e.g. withdrawals and refunds, if applicable) are not affected. ([#832](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/832))
   * `ERC20`: `transferFrom` and `_burnFrom ` now emit `Approval` events, to represent the token's state comprehensively through events. ([#1524](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1524))
   * `ERC721`: added `_burn(uint256 tokenId)`, replacing the similar deprecated function (see below). ([#1550](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1550))
   * `ERC721`: added `_tokensOfOwner(address owner)`, allowing to internally retrieve the array of an account's owned tokens. ([#1522](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1522))
   * Crowdsales: all constructors are now `public`, meaning it is not necessary to extend these contracts in order to deploy them. The exception is `FinalizableCrowdsale`, since it is meaningless unless extended. ([#1564](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1564))
   * `SignedSafeMath`: added overflow-safe operations for signed integers (`int256`). ([#1559](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1559), [#1588](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1588))
  
  ### Improvements
   * The compiler version required by `Array` was behind the rest of the library so it was updated to `v0.4.24`. ([#1553](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1553))
   * Now conforming to a 4-space indentation code style. ([1508](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1508))
   * `ERC20`: more gas efficient due to removed redundant `require`s. ([#1409](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1409))
   * `ERC721`: fixed a bug that prevented internal data structures from being properly cleaned, missing potential gas refunds. ([#1539](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1539) and [#1549](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1549))
   * `ERC721`: general gas savings on `transferFrom`, `_mint` and `_burn`, due to redudant `require`s and `SSTORE`s. ([#1549](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1549))
  
  ### Bugfixes
  
  ### Breaking changes
  
  ### Deprecations
   * `ERC721._burn(address owner, uint256 tokenId)`: due to the `owner` parameter being unnecessary. ([#1550](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1550))
   * `RefundableCrowdsale`: due to trading abuse potential on crowdsales that miss their goal. ([#1543](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/pull/1543))

  Contributing to OpenZeppelin Contracts
  =======
  
  We really appreciate and value contributions to OpenZeppelin Contracts. Please take 5' to review the items listed below to make sure that your contributions are merged as soon as possible.
  
  ## Contribution guidelines
  
  Smart contracts manage value and are highly vulnerable to errors and attacks. We have very strict [guidelines], please make sure to review them!
  
  ## Creating Pull Requests (PRs)
  
  As a contributor, you are expected to fork this repository, work on your own fork and then submit pull requests. The pull requests will be reviewed and eventually merged into the main repo. See ["Fork-a-Repo"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for how this works.
  
  ## A typical workflow
  
  1) Make sure your fork is up to date with the main repository:
  
  ```
  cd openzeppelin-contracts
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts.git
  git fetch upstream
  git pull --rebase upstream master
  ```
  NOTE: The directory `openzeppelin-contracts` represents your fork's local copy.
  
  2) Branch out from `master` into `fix/some-bug-#123`:
  (Postfixing #123 will associate your PR with the issue #123 and make everyone's life easier =D)
  ```
  git checkout -b fix/some-bug-#123
  ```
  
  3) Make your changes, add your files, commit, and push to your fork.
  
  ```
  git add SomeFile.js
  git commit "Fix some bug #123"
  git push origin fix/some-bug-#123
  ```
  
  4) Run tests, linter, etc. This can be done by running local continuous integration and make sure it passes.
  
  ```bash
  npm test
  npm run lint
  ```
  
  5) Go to [github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) in your web browser and issue a new pull request.
  
  *IMPORTANT* Read the PR template very carefully and make sure to follow all the instructions. These instructions
  refer to some very important conditions that your PR must meet in order to be accepted, such as making sure that all tests pass, JS linting tests pass, Solidity linting tests pass, etc.
  
  6) Maintainers will review your code and possibly ask for changes before your code is pulled in to the main repository. We'll check that all tests pass, review the coding style, and check for general code correctness. If everything is OK, we'll merge your pull request and your code will be part of OpenZeppelin Contracts.
  
  *IMPORTANT* Please pay attention to the maintainer's feedback, since it's a necessary step to keep up with the standards OpenZeppelin Contracts attains to.
  
  ## All set!
  
  If you have any questions, feel free to post them to github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues.
  
  Finally, if you're looking to collaborate and want to find easy tasks to start, look at the issues we marked as ["Good first issue"](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/labels/good%20first%20issue).
  
  Thanks for your time and code!

  Design Guidelines
  =======
  
  These are some global design goals in OpenZeppelin Contracts.
  
  #### D0 - Security in Depth
  We strive to provide secure, tested, audited code. To achieve this, we need to match intention with function. Thus, documentation, code clarity, community review and security discussions are fundamental.
  
  #### D1 - Simple and Modular
  Simpler code means easier audits, and better understanding of what each component does. We look for small files, small contracts, and small functions. If you can separate a contract into two independent functionalities you should probably do it.
  
  #### D2 - Naming Matters
  
  We take our time with picking names. Code is going to be written once, and read hundreds of times. Renaming for clarity is encouraged.
  
  #### D3 - Tests
  
  Write tests for all your code. We encourage Test Driven Development so we know when our code is right. Even though not all code in the repository is tested at the moment, we aim to test every line of code in the future.
  
  #### D4 - Check preconditions and post-conditions
  
  A very important way to prevent vulnerabilities is to catch a contract’s inconsistent state as early as possible. This is why we want functions to check pre- and post-conditions for executing its logic. When writing code, ask yourself what you are expecting to be true before and after the function runs, and express it in code.
  
  #### D5 - Code Consistency
  
  Consistency on the way classes are used is paramount to an easier understanding of the library. The codebase should be as unified as possible. Read existing code and get inspired before you write your own. Follow the style guidelines. Don’t hesitate to ask for help on how to best write a specific piece of code.
  
  #### D6 - Regular Audits
  Following good programming practices is a way to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities, but professional code audits are still needed. We will perform regular code audits on major releases, and hire security professionals to provide independent review.
  
  # Style Guidelines
  
  The design guidelines have quite a high abstraction level. These style guidelines are more concrete and easier to apply, and also more opinionated. We value clean code and consistency, and those are prerequisites for us to include new code in the repository. Before proposing a change, please read these guidelines and take some time to familiarize yourself with the style of the existing codebase.
  
  ## Solidity code
  
  In order to be consistent with all the other Solidity projects, we follow the
  [official recommendations documented in the Solidity style guide](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html).
  
  Any exception or additions specific to our project are documented below.
  
  * Try to avoid acronyms and abbreviations.
  
  * All state variables should be private.
  
  * Private state variables should have an underscore prefix.
  
      ```
      contract TestContract {
        uint256 private _privateVar;
        uint256 internal _internalVar;
      }
      ```
  
  * Parameters must not be prefixed with an underscore.
  
      ```
      function test(uint256 testParameter1, uint256 testParameter2) {
      ...
      }
      ```
  
  * Internal and private functions should have an underscore prefix.
  
      ```
      function _testInternal() internal {
        ...
      }
      ```
  
      ```
      function _testPrivate() private {
        ...
      }
      ```
  
  * Events should be emitted immediately after the state change that they
    represent, and consequently they should be named in past tense.
  
      ```
      function _burn(address who, uint256 value) internal {
        super._burn(who, value);
        emit TokensBurned(who, value);
      }
      ```
  
    Some standards (e.g. ERC20) use present tense, and in those cases the
    standard specification prevails.
    
  * Interface names should have a capital I prefix.
  
      ```
      interface IERC777 {
      ```
  
  
  ## Tests
  
  * Tests Must be Written Elegantly
  
      Tests are a good way to show how to use the library, and maintaining them is extremely necessary. Don't write long tests, write helper functions to make them be as short and concise as possible (they should take just a few lines each), and use good variable names.
  
  * Tests Must not be Random
  
      Inputs for tests should not be generated randomly. Accounts used to create test contracts are an exception, those can be random. Also, the type and structure of outputs should be checked.

  This repository hosts the Upgradeable variant of [OpenZeppelin Contracts], meant for use in upgradeable contracts. This variant is available as separate package called `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.
  
  [OpenZeppelin Contracts]: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
  
  It follows all of the rules for [Writing Upgradeable Contracts]: constructors are replaced by initializer functions, state variables are initialized in initializer functions, and we additionally check for storage incompatibilities across minor versions.
  
  [Writing Upgradeable Contracts]: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/writing-upgradeable
  
  > :warning: **Warning**
  >
  > There will be storage incompatibilities across major versions of this package, which makes it unsafe to upgrade a deployed contract from one major version to another, for example from 3.4.0 to 4.0.0.
  > 
  > Similarly, it is not safe to upgrade from `@openzeppelin/contracts-ethereum-package` (a similar previous package) to `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable`.
  >
  > **It is strongly encouraged to use these contracts together with a tool that can automatically guarantee the safety of an upgradeable contract, such as the [OpenZeppelin Upgrades Plugins](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades).**

  ## Overview
  
  ### Installation
  
  ```console
  $ npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable
  ```
  
  OpenZeppelin Contracts features a [stable API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/releases-stability#api-stability), which means your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a newer minor version.
  
  An alternative to npm is to use the GitHub repository `openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts` to retrieve the contracts. When doing this, make sure to specify the tag for a release such as `v4.5.0`, instead of using the `master` branch.
  
  ### Usage
  
  The package replicates the structure of the main OpenZeppelin Contracts package, but every file and contract has the suffix `Upgradeable`.
  
  ```diff
  -import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
  +import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol";
   
  -contract MyCollectible is ERC721 {
  +contract MyCollectible is ERC721Upgradeable {
  ```
  
  Constructors are replaced by internal initializer functions following the naming convention `__{ContractName}_init`. Since these are internal, you must always define your own public initializer function and call the parent initializer of the contract you extend.
  
  ```diff
  -    constructor() ERC721("MyCollectible", "MCO") {
  +    function initialize() initializer public {
  +        __ERC721_init("MyCollectible", "MCO");
       }
  ```
  
  > **Caution**
  >
  > Use with multiple inheritance requires special care. Initializer functions are not linearized by the compiler like constructors. Because of this, each `__{ContractName}_init` function embeds the linearized calls to all parent initializers. As a consequence, calling two of these `init` functions can potentially initialize the same contract twice.
  >
  > The function `__{ContractName}_init_unchained` found in every contract is the initializer function minus the calls to parent initializers, and can be used to avoid the double initialization problem, but doing this manually is not recommended. We hope to be able to implement safety checks for this in future versions of the Upgrades Plugins.
  
  _If you're new to smart contract development, head to [Developing Smart Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts._
  
  To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
  
  ## Learn More
  
  The guides in the [docs site](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts) will teach about different concepts, and how to use the related contracts that OpenZeppelin Contracts provides:
  
  * [Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/access-control): decide who can perform each of the actions on your system.
  * [Tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/tokens): create tradeable assets or collectives, and distribute them via [Crowdsales](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/crowdsales).
  * [Gas Station Network](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/gsn): let your users interact with your contracts without having to pay for gas themselves.
  * [Utilities](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/utilities): generic useful tools, including non-overflowing math, signature verification, and trustless paying systems.
  
  The [full API](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/api/token/ERC20) is also thoroughly documented, and serves as a great reference when developing your smart contract application. You can also ask for help or follow Contracts's development in the [community forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com).
  
  Finally, you may want to take a look at the [guides on our blog](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/guides), which cover several common use cases and good practices.. The following articles provide great background reading, though please note, some of the referenced tools have changed as the tooling in the ecosystem continues to rapidly evolve.
  
  * [The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Smart Contracts in Ethereum](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05) will help you get an overview of the various tools available for smart contract development, and help you set up your environment.
  * [A Gentle Introduction to Ethereum Programming, Part 1](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/a-gentle-introduction-to-ethereum-programming-part-1-783cc7796094) provides very useful information on an introductory level, including many basic concepts from the Ethereum platform.

  ## Merging the release branch
  
  After the final release, the release branch should be merged back into `master`. This merge must not be squashed because it would lose the tagged release commit. Since the GitHub repo is set up to only allow squashed merges, the merge should be done locally and pushed.
  
  Make sure to have the latest changes from `upstream` in your local release branch.
  
  ```
  git checkout release-vX.Y.Z
  git pull upstream
  ```
  
  ```
  git checkout master
  git merge --no-ff release-vX.Y.Z
  git push upstream master
  ```
  
  The release branch can then be deleted on GitHub.

  # Technical notes about the Upgradeable repository
  
  ## [Branches](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/branches)
  
  ### `patches`
  
  Built on top of the `master` branch of the vanilla Contracts repo, contains the changes necessary to build this package: it adds the scripts to transpile and GitHub Actions for it to work automatically, changes the package name, etc.
  
  It can also include small changes to the Solidity code, such as reordering of state variables, in order to ensure storage compatibility.
  
  It's an important goal that this branch should be easy to merge with the vanilla Contracts repo, avoiding merge conflicts as much as possible. This is necessary to reduce manual intervention and ensure automation runs smoothly.
  
  This branch will not necessarily be up to date with the vanilla `master` branch, only up to the point necessary to guarantee successful merging with any new updates. In some cases it will be necessary to apply a manual merge with new changes, it is this branch that should be updated for the changes to propagate to all other branches.
  
  ### `patched/master`, `patched/release-vX.Y`
  
  These branches are the merge between `patches` and the corresponding branch from vanilla Contracts. These branches should generally not be updated manually.
  
  ### `master`, `release-vX.Y`
  
  Contains the transpiled code corresponding to the branch from vanilla Contracts of the same name. These are generated automatically based on their `patched/*` branch. These branches should never be manually updated, because they will be overwritten automatically with the transpiled version of `patched/*`. Instead, changes should be made in `patches`.
  
  ## [Actions Workflows](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/actions)
  
  ### [Merge upstream](/.github/workflows/merge-upstream.yml)
  
  All this does is fetch the latest changes from a corresponding branch in the vanilla Contracts repo, tries to merge them with `patches`, and then pushes the updated branch to `patched/*`. If the merge has conflicts, the worfklow will fail. We should be notified of this so that we can updated the `patches` branch resolving conflicts and trigger the merge again. This should not happen often.
  
  ### [Transpile](/.github/workflows/transpile.yml)
  
  Runs every time a `patched/*` branch is pushed to (for example as part of the Merge upstream workflow), transpiles the contents of that branch, and pushes the results as a new commit on the transpiled branch.
  
  ### [Test](/.github/workflows/test.yml)
  
  Runs normal Contracts tests on the `master` and `release-v*` branches.
  
  ## Scripts
  
  ### `transpile-onto.sh`
  
  ```
  bash scripts/upgradeable/transpile-onto.sh <target> [base]
  ```
  
  Transpiles the contents of the current git branch and commits the result as a new commit on branch `<target>`. If branch `<target>` doesn't exist, it will copy the commit history of `[base]` (this is used in GitHub Actions, but is usually not necessary locally).
  
  This script can be used manually to build transpiled versions of specific commits, or branches other than the `master` Contracts branch.
